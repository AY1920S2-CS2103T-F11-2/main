<div class="paragraph">
<p>FitBiz is a fitness business management application, specially made for fitness coaches to manage their clients. It is primarily a desktop application where the user interacts via the Command Line Interface (CLI), and views data via the Graphical User Interface (GUI). This project is written in Java 11, packaged using Gradle, and uses JavaFX for the GUI.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: developed the <a href="#command-autocomplete">Command Autocomplete</a> feature, which allows users to conveniently autocomplete commands and their parameter prefixes using the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What it does</strong>: allows users to input FitBiz&#8217;s commands with ease without having to memorise the syntax of every command available. Since our users are fast typists and prefer to use the keyboard, this feature also allows them to efficiently get to the next prefix by hitting <kbd>Tab</kbd>, instead of wasting time using their mouse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Justification</strong>: previously, users would have to refer to the User Guide frequently (or rely on the <code>help</code> command) for the syntax of FitBiz&#8217;s commands. This feature greatly lowers the barriers to entry for this application, and also enhances the user experience by providing a much faster way for users to interact with the CLI via the keyboard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Highlights</strong>: developed a custom <code>Trie</code> data structure which was written to be easily extensible for future commands and custom logic to be added. This feature is also contextually aware, and will provide ample and useful feedback to the user (like similar commands found, or the usage of the current autocompleted command).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: developed the <a href="#command-history">Command History</a> feature, which allows users to store their previously entered commands, and which they can access using the <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> and <kbd>&darr;</kbd> keys.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What it does</strong>: allows users to efficiently and conveniently access and repeat their previously entered commands (be it valid or invalid) any time within the Command Box.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Justification</strong>: previously, if the command was successful, users would have to type out the full command again if they had wanted to repeat it. Now, users can easily repeat or tweak their previously entered commands without wasting precious time typing everything again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Highlights</strong>: this feature was made to mimic most modern interpreters, and as such, will be very familiar to most users comfortable with using a CLI application. The history was also made to persist on the storage, so users can expect to come back to the application after a previous session and still access their previous command history of said session.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor enhancement</strong>: developed the <a href="#export-command"><code>export</code></a> command which allows users to export their clients' recorded exercises into a CSV file which can then be viewed in other spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel, or easily shared with their clients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor enhancement</strong>: redesigned the overall user interface and enhanced the user experience by providing better visual feedback cues to the GUI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor enhancement</strong>: added the target and current weight attributes to the <code>Client</code> class.</p>

<h3 id="understanding-the-cli"><a class="link" href="#understanding-the-cli">Understanding the Command Line Interface (CLI) --- Aaron Choo</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even though FitBiz comes with a GUI, it is mainly used to display data. Most of the user interaction occurs via the CLI, which in FitBiz, is comprised of the <strong>Command Box</strong> and the <strong>Result Box</strong>. We understand that CLIs have higher barriers to entry and may scare some inexperienced users away. As such, we have provided some features common to most modern CLIs to make your user experience with FitBiz much better. In this section, we shall look at the <strong>Command History</strong> and the <strong>Command Autocomplete</strong> feature, and learn how to effectively utilise them.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="command-history"><a class="link" href="#command-history">Command History</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similar to most modern CLIs, users of FitBiz can press the <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> and <kbd>&darr;</kbd> arrow keys to cycle through their previously entered commands. If you have prior experience in using a CLI, feel free to skip this section as this should be second nature to you. If not, here is a quick tutorial on how to use this time saving feature.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, start by typing anything into the <strong>Command Box</strong>. It <em>need not</em> have to be a valid command (like those shown in <a href="#Commands">[Commands]</a>). In our example, we chose to type <code>Hello World</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../images/command-history-hello-world.png" alt="command history hello world">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, hit the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to enter the command into FitBiz. Notice that whatever you have typed in the <strong>Command Box</strong> should have disappeared. If you did not enter a valid command (like <code>Hello World</code>), the border of the <strong>Command Box</strong> would have turned red, and you would have been prompted by a message saying <code>Unknown command</code> in the <strong>Result Box</strong> like shown:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../images/command-history-unknown-command.png" alt="command history unknown command">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, continue entering different commands into the <strong>Command Box</strong>. You can safely ignore all the <code>Unknown command</code> prompts for now.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you feel like you have entered enough commands into FitBiz, try hitting the <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> key several times. You should start to see the history of your entered commands displaying in the <strong>Command Box</strong> in reverse chronological order. If you press the <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> key enough times (or simply hold down the key), you would realise that the command in the <strong>Command Box</strong> no longer changes. In our case, it displays <code>Hello World</code>, our first ever entered command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Likewise, you can also see your more recent commands by pressing the <kbd>&darr;</kbd> key. Again, if you press it enough times, you would realise that the text from the <strong>Command Box</strong> disappeares (right after displaying your most recent command). This means that you have reached the end of your command history.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock tip">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-tip" title="Tip"></i>
</td>
<td class="content">
If you are not currently browsing the history, you can press the <kbd>&darr;</kbd> key to immediately clear what you are currently typing in the <strong>Command Box</strong>.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="command-autocomplete"><a class="link" href="#command-autocomplete">Command Autocomplete</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Again, similar to most modern CLIs, users of FitBiz can press the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key to autocomplete commands that they have partially typed. If the partially typed letters uniquely identifies a valid command in FitBiz (see <a href="#Commands">[Commands]</a>), the complete command will automatically appear in the <strong>Command Box</strong>. Otherwise, a list of all commands similar to the ambiguous letters will appear in the <strong>Result Box</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, we understand that some of FitBiz&#8217;s commands may be particularly long and diffcult to remember. In order to remedy this, we have also provided <strong>autocompletion of parameter prefixes</strong> for some commands, as well as the <strong>use of <kbd>Tab</kbd> to easily get to the next prefix</strong>. When autocompleting commands, the caret position will also be automatically set to the most optimal position corresponding to the completed command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To see this feature in action, type <code>add-c</code> into the <strong>Command Box</strong> and press <kbd>Tab</kbd>:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../images/autocomplete-1.png" alt="autocomplete 1">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Immediately, you should have noticed three things:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>All the parameter prefixes pertaining to the <code>add-c</code> command have been automatically completed for you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your caret is placed right after the <code>n/</code> for you to type your parameter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Result Box</strong> shows you the usage of the <code>add-c</code> command</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, you can also press the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key repeatedly to go to the next parameter prefix, instead of wasting time using your mouse.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note however, that there are some similar commands in FitBiz that have the same few starting letters. For example: both <code>add-c</code> and <code>add-e</code> starts with the letter "a". As such, hitting <kbd>Tab</kbd> when you have only typed <code>a</code> in the <strong>Command Box</strong> will not autocomplete either command (unfortunately, FitBiz cannot read your mind). However, you will find that the command will be completed up till <code>add-</code>, the point where <code>add-e</code> and <code>add-c</code> differs. The <strong>Result Box</strong> will also prompt you with the list of all similar commands found:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../images/autocomplete-2.png" alt="autocomplete 2">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To autocomplete the parameter prefixes like in the first example above, you would just have to complete the command and press <kbd>Tab</kbd> once more.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock tip">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-tip" title="Tip"></i>
</td>
<td class="content">
Commands and their parameters in FitBiz are always separated by white spaces (ie. <code>schedule 1 sch/</code>). As such, the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key will only try to autocomplete your command if your current input in the <strong>Command Box</strong> is a single word. In other words, if your input is made up of more than one word separated by white spaces, FitBiz will ignore your use of <kbd>Tab</kbd>. Do not be surprised when you try to autocomplete more than a single word like <code>add some thing</code>, and yet receive no response from FitBiz.

The autocompletion of the parameter prefixes are only for these commands: <code>add-c</code>, <code>add-e</code>, <code>filter-c</code>, <code>graph</code>, and <code>schedule</code>.

</table>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the interest of saving developement time and better code readability, we decided to use an <code>ArrayList</code> to store the commands. Since we have decided to cap the maximum size of the list, should this limit be exceeded, we would then need to remove the first item (or the zeroth index) from the list to free up space. Of course, doing a <code>remove(0)</code> on a n-item <code>ArrayList</code> will require that all remaining items in the list be reassigned to new indices, and thus incur an O(n) time operation. However, we found out through extensive testing that this causes no observable nor significant lag when the maximum capacity is reached.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Moreover, there is also a need to overwrite the whole storage file <code>command.txt</code> whenever this maximum size is reached. Before this maximum size is reached, we can easily append to the existing file the new command that the user has just entered. However, after this limit is exceeded, we must remove the first line stored in <code>command.txt</code>, shift all remaining lines up, and then append that new line. Hard disk operations like writing to storage is many order of magnitudes slower than memory operations like the reassignment of indices as discussed above. Since the much larger bottleneck is in the storage, this effectively nullifies the time complexity comparison that a <code>LinkedList</code> is faster than an <code>ArrayList</code> in removing the first item.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In choosing the maximum size of the command history, we have to take note of some important caveats:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>This number must be small enough to not cause the app to lag when the whole history is being written to storage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This number must be big enough to satisfy the user</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ultimately, we felt that 100 is a very generous estimate given that a user really only needs the past few commands at any point of time.</p>

<h5 id="how-the-trie-data-structure-works"><a class="link" href="#how-the-trie-data-structure-works">How the Trie data structure works</a></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since Java does not provide a native Trie data structure, we had to implement our own version of it. Moreover, Java also does not allow methods with multiple return values, and thus, we had to create a wrapper class <code>SimilarWordsResult</code> to store the multiple results returned by <code>Trie#listAllSimilarWords</code>. In this section, we shall take a more in depth look at the overall implementation of this data structure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We first look at the <code>Node</code> class provided in the same package which <code>Trie</code> relies on. Each <code>Node</code> object should contain the following attributes:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The parent node (<code>null</code> if the node is the root of the Trie)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The current letter it represents</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The children nodes (if any)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A boolean to know whether that node represents a completed word</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since each node stores with it their parent node pointer, we can easily construct the word represented by a node by recursively building the word up letter by letter until the root is reached. This is implemented in <code>Node#constructWord</code>, as shown here:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="CodeRay highlight"><code data-lang="java"><span class="directive">public</span> <span class="predefined-type">String</span> constructWord() {

      }
      <span class="keyword">return</span> parent.constructWord() + getLetter();
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, let us discuss about how we implemented <code>Trie</code> to support the <a href="#command-history-behaviour">behaviours discussed above</a> by first looking at <code>Trie#getLongestPrefixNode</code>. This method takes in an argument <code>word</code> and returns in 3 distinct cases:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">

<li>
<p>If the argument <code>word</code> matches no words currently in the <code>Trie</code>: <code>null</code></p>

</li>
<li>
<p>If the argument <code>word</code> is ambiguous: the <code>Node</code> whose constructed word is the longest common prefix of all words similar to <code>word</code> contained in <code>Trie</code></p>

<p>Within the <code>execute</code> method, <code>Autocomplete</code> calls the <code>listAllSimilarWords</code> method from <code>Trie</code> with the user input text. <code>Trie</code>, which would already have all the commands stored, finds the longest prefix node, calls the <code>constructWord</code> method from this node, and checks if this node represents the end of a completed word. Since it is indeed a completed word, <code>Trie</code> immediately creates a <code>SimilarWordsResult</code> object to store these information and returns it to <code>Autocomplete</code>. Then, <code>Autocomplete</code> retrieves these information, realises that it is dealing with an unambiguous command, and constructs the corresponding prefixes. It then creates a <code>AutocompleteResult</code> object to store all the information that <code>CommandBox</code> requires, and finally returns this object to <code>CommandBox</code>.</p>

<p>Lastly, in order to explain the key decisions that this feature does at each step starting from the point where the user presses <kbd>Tab</kbd>, we have provided the following activity diagram:</p>

<p>This feature currently only supports autocompletion of <em>commands</em> and <em>prefixes</em>, and not other fields/parameters like names and addresses that have been used by the user before. Implicitly, since all commands defined in FitBiz do not have empty spaces in them, this allows us to easily determine when to allow users to press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to get to the next prefix (<a href="#command-history-behaviour-4">behaviour 4</a>): by simply checking for the presence of white spaces from the trimmed user input.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As discussed in the <a href="#command-history-implementation">implementation section</a>, we have decided to use a Trie data structure. Of course, we have also considered other much simpler alternatives like simply storing all available commands in a native Java <code>List</code>. A quick summary of the pros and cons is given here:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As such, the choice of implementing our own Trie data structure is obvious. As this app grows bigger in the forseeable future, the number of commands as well as the number of things we would want to autocomplete would increase. Overall, we felt that the Trie data structure will scale much better as compared to a List.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Exchanging some initial development time for future scalability of our app will ensure that we, or future developers, do not end up wasting time refactoring what could have been done in the first place. Moreover, the Trie data structure is much more effective and computationally inexpensive in finding the longest common prefix of all ambiguous commands. The same cannot be said when using a List.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, since we have implemented our own Trie data structure, it would also allow more custom logic to be added later, and allow more creative freedom with respect to the features that we, or future developers would want to add. For example, future version of this application might want to also include the autocompletion of frequently used parameters by the user.</p>
