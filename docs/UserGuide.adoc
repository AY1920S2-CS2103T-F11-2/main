== Overview

=== About FitBiz

FitBiz is a fitness business management tool tailor made for fitness coaches to manage their clients. From managing your client's profile to planning your schedules, FitBiz will surely ease the pain and monotony of managing a small to medium client portfolio.

This program is primarily a desktop application and is very optimised for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI). If you can type fast, and have clients to train and manage, FitBiz is definitely for you!

=== About this User Guide

This User Guide explains how to use FitBiz, as well as provides an understanding of the features and commands and some common use cases of this application.

In this guide, we cover:

* How to navigate the Graphical User Interface (GUI)
* Syntax of the commands available in FitBiz
* Common use cases for each command
* Common problems encountered by users

=== Understanding the Graphical User Interface (GUI)

When you first launch FitBiz, you will be greeted by the GUI. In this section, we shall learn about what each section of this GUI is responsible for.

// diagram for hello world command box
.FitBiz GUI Layout
image::Ui-annotated.png[]

* **Command Box**: this is where you enter your commands
** Note that the border will glow green if your command is successfully executed, and red otherwise
* **Result Box**: this displays feedback and other useful information about your commands that you have just entered
* **Client List**: this displays all your clients currently recorded in FitBiz
* **Schedule Panel**: this displays all your schedules of your clients
* **Client View**: this displays all the important details about the client you are currently viewing (which we refer to as _client in view_). In here, we have 3 further sections:
** **Client Details**: this displays other information about your client that is otherwise not found in **Client List**
** **Exercise Table**: this displays all the exercises recorded for the current _client in view_
** **Personal Best Table**: this displays the personal bests of the exercises done by the current _client in view_

[TIP]
If this is your first time using FitBiz and you have just started up the application, you may realise that the *Client View* section is missing. This is because you are currently not viewing a client. Refer to <<view-c-command>> for more information about what you need to do.

=== Understanding the Command Line Interface (CLI) --- Aaron Choo

Even though FitBiz comes with a GUI, it is mainly used to display data. Most of the user interaction occurs via the CLI, which in FitBiz is comprised of the *Command Box* and *Result Box*. We understand that CLIs have higher barriers of entry and may scare some inexperienced users away. As such, we have provided some features common to most modern CLIs to make your user experience with FitBiz much better. In this section, we shall look at the **Command History** and the **Command Autocomplete** feature, and learn how to effectively utilise them.

==== Command History

Similar to most modern CLIs, users of FitBiz can press the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] arrow key to cycle through their previously entered commands. If you have prior experience in using a CLI, feel free to skip this section as this should be second nature to you. If not, here is a quick tutorial on how to use this time saving feature.

First, start by typing anything into the *Command Box*. It _need not_ have to be a valid command (like those shown in <<Commands>>). In our example, we chose to type `Hello World`:

// diagram for hello world command box
image::command-history-hello-world.png[]

Next, hit the kbd:[Enter] key to enter the command into FitBiz. Notice that whatever you have typed in the *Command Box* should have disappeared. If you did not enter a valid command (like `Hello World`), the border of the *Command Box* would have turned red, and you would have been prompted by a message saying `Unknown command` in the *Result Box* like shown:

// diagram for invalid command
image::command-history-unknown-command.png[]

Next, continue entering different commands into the *Command Box*. You can safely ignore all the `Unknown command` prompts for now.

Once you feel like you have entered enough commands into FitBiz, try hitting the kbd:[&uarr;] arrow key several times. You should start to see the history of your entered commands displaying in the *Command Box* in reverse chronological order. If you press the kbd:[&uarr;] arrow key enough times (or simply hold down the key), you would realise that the command in the *Command Box* no longer changes. In our case, it currently displays `Hello World`, our first ever entered command.

Now, you can also see your more recent commands by pressing the kbd:[&darr;] arrow key. Again, if you press it enough times, you would realise that the *Command Box* will display nothing (right after displaying your most recent command). This means that you have reached the end of your command history.

[TIP]
If you are not currently browsing the history, you can press the kbd:[&darr;] arrow key to immediately clear what you are currently typing in the *Command Box*.

==== Command Autocompletion

Again, similar to most modern CLIs, users of FitBiz can press the kbd:[Tab] key to autocomplete commands that they have partially typed. If the partially typed letters uniquely identifies a valid command in FitBiz (see <<Commands>>), the complete command will automatically appear in the Command Box. Otherwise, a list of all commands similar to the ambiguous letters will appear in the *Result Box*.

Also, we understand that some of FitBiz's commands may be very long and diffcult to remember. In order to remedy this, we have also provided *autocompletion of parameter prefixes*, as well as the ability to *use tab to easily get to the next prefix*.

To see this feature in action, type `add-c` into the *Command Box* and press kbd:[Tab]:

image::autocomplete-1.png[]

Immediately, you should have noticed three things:

. All the parameter prefixes pertaining to the `add-c` command should have been automatically completed for you
. Your caret should be placed right after the `n/` for you to type your parameter
. The **Result Box** shows you the usage of the command that have just been autocompleted

Now, you can also press the kbd:[Tab] key repeatedly to go to the next parameter prefix, instead of wasting time using your mouse.

Note however, that there are some similar commands in FitBiz that have the same few starting letters. For example: both `add-c` and `add-e` starts with the letter "a". As such, hitting kbd:[Tab] when you have only typed `a` in the *Command Box* will not autocomplete either command (unfortunately, FitBiz cannot read your mind). However, you will find that the command will be completed up till `add-`, the point where `add-e` and `add-c` differs. The **Result Box** will also prompt you with the list of all similar commands found:

image::autocomplete-2.png[]

To autocomplete the parameter prefixes like in the first example above, you would just have to complete the command and press kbd:[Tab] once more.

[NOTE]
The autocompletion of the parameter prefixes are only for these commands: `add-c`, `add-e`, `filter-c`, `graph`, and `schedule`. Autocompletion of prefixes for edit commands are not included as we understand that most likely than not, users would only choose to edit one field at a time.

== Quick Start

. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer
. Download the latest `FitBiz.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here]
. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Fitness Manager
. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds
. Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. e.g. typing `help` and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
. Some example commands you can try:
* `list-c` : lists all clients
* `add-c n/John Doe g/Male p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 b/24-12-1997 h/170 cw/70 tw/75`
: adds a client named John Doe to FitBiz
* `exit` : exits the app
. Refer to <<Commands>> below for details of each command

== Commands

This section introduces the syntax and the usages of the commands available in FitBiz. In explaining the syntax, we will adhere to the following format:

* Words in `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user
** e.g. in `add-c n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add-c n/John Doe`
* Items in square brackets are optional
** e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`
* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times
** e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order
** e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable

=== View help: `help`

Opens a window with the link to the User Guide. `Currently in v1.3`
Lists all available commands and a short description of what they do. Specify the command for more detailed explanation. `Coming in v1.4`

Format: `help [c/COMMAND]`

Examples:

* `help`
** Lists all commands
* `help add-c`
** Shows a detailed explanation of the `add-c` command

=== List all clients: `list-c`

Shows all clients currently entered in this program.

* Note that this is the default view when you first launch FitBiz

Format: `list-c`

=== Find clients by name: `find-c` --- Yong Jie
`find-c` allows you to find clients with the names that are specified in your input. You might have many clients and finding a particular client by scrolling through the entire *Client List* might be troublesome and difficult. `find-c` is the command for you.

==== Parameters
This section acts as a summary of the important things to note when using `find-c` including their parameters.

Format: `find-c NAME`

[options='header']
[cols="15%,85%"]
|====================
| Parameters | Important points to note
| NAME |
* Substitute `NAME` with keywords you want to search with +

* You can use multiple keywords for `NAME`. +
e.g. You can enter `find-c bryan low`.

* The `NAME` keywords are case insensitive. +
e.g. Typing `find-c hans` will show clients even with the name `Hans`. +
For a better understanding, you can refer to the example section .

* The keywords used for `NAME` have to match at least one word in the name of the clients. +
e.g. Typing `find-c Bry` will not show clients with the name `Bryan`. +
For a detailed explanation, you can refer to the commons errors / problems section.

* Clients matching at least one `NAME` keyword will be returned and does not require all the words in their name to match. +
e.g. Typing `find-c Hans Bo` will show clients `Hans Gruber` and `Bo Yang` and not necessarily just client `Hans Bo`. +
For a detailed explanation, you can refer to the commons errors / problems section.
|====================

==== Example
Let's say that you want to find a client named "Bryan Low" in *Client List*. You can simply use the `find-c` command as shown.

. Type `find-c bryan` into *Command Box*, and press `Enter` to execute it.
+
image::ug-findcExamplePart1.png[]

. *Result Box* will display the message of the number of clients listed. In this case, there are 2 clients with "bryan" in their name.
+
image::ug-findcExamplePart2.png[]

. You can now see the clients with "bryan" in their names. As you can see, the name you use to search does not need to be case-senstive. The client that we are looking for "Bryan Low" is in *Client List*.
+
image::ug-findcExamplePart3.png[]

==== Common errors / problems
You might face some errors or difficulties when you `find-c`. In this section, you will be able to understand these errors and resolve them. You will also get a better understanding of the reply from the result box when using `find-c`.

===== Using incomplete names
You might wonder why `find-c` do not show the clients even though the client is clearly in your client list records. It might be possible that you have entered an incomplete name and does not match any word in the name of that client. The example below might help you understand better.

Example:
You want to find the client named "Bryan Low" in *Client List*. Below shows that "Bryan Low" indeed exists and is recorded.

image::ug-findcIncompleteNamePart1.png[]

Type `find-c bry` into *Command Box*, and press `Enter` to execute it.

image::ug-findcIncompleteNamePart2.png[]

You will obtain "0 clients listed!" in *Result Box*.

image::ug-findcIncompleteNamePart3.png[]

This is because the name that you have entered is incomplete and does not match any word in the name of any of the clients. To correct this, you have to enter `find-c bryan` as seen in the example.

===== Using multiple keywords for `NAME`

You might wonder why the application shows more clients than you intended. It might be possible that you have misunderstood how the `NAME` parameter gets the client you are finding. The application will show clients as long as one of the words of the client match a keyword you use for name. The example below might help you understand better.

Example:
You want to find the client named "Bryan Low" in *Client List*.

Type `find-c bryan low` in to *Command Box*, and press `Enter` to execute it.

image::ug-findcMultiplePart1.png[]

You will obtain clients which have `bryan` in their name or `low` in the name. In the case below, there are 3 clients. `Bryan Low`, `Bryan Tan` and `Alice Low`.

image::ug-findcMultiplePart2.png[]

You can try to enter keywords for `NAME` that are more specific to the client you are looking for. This will help to keep your search more scoped.

=== Add a new client profile: `add-c`

Initialises and adds a new client profile.

Format: `add-c n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [g/GENDER] [h/HEIGHT] [cw/CURRENT_WEIGHT] [tw/TARGET_WEIGHT] [r/REMARK] [s/SPORT]… [t/TAG]…`

* `n/NAME` is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of words will matter. e.g `Hans Ong` will not match `Ong Hans`
* Only exact match will be shown. e.g. `Hans` will not match `Hans Ong`
* A client can have any number of tags (including 0)

Examples:

* `add-c n/Ming Liang p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`
** Adds a new client: Ming Liang with the above information
* `add-c n/Low Tah Kiow, John t/powerlifter e/betsycrowe@example.com a/some street p/1234567 t/strongman`
** Adds a new client: Low Tah Kiow, John with the above information

=== Edit a client’s profile: `edit-c`

Edits the client’s cliental details by specifying the attribute and the new value.

Format: `edit-c INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [g/GENDER] [h/HEIGHT] [cw/CURRENT_WEIGHT] [tw/TARGET_WEIGHT] [r/REMARK] [s/SPORT]… [t/TAG]...`

* `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed client list
* `INDEX` must be a positive integer (ie. 1, 2, 3, ...)
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the client will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative
* You can remove all the client’s tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it

Examples:

* `edit-c 1 n/Ming Liang a/60 a/male`
** Edits the name of the 1st client to Ming Liang, age to 60, and gender to male.

=== Delete a client: `delete-c` --- Li Zi Ying

You find that your client list contains a client who is no longer working with you and you would like to remove his details from your client list. `delete-c` allows you to delete the client at the specified index from your list of clients.

==== Parameters
This section acts as a summary of the important things to note when using `delete-c` including their parameters.

Format: `delete-c INDEX`

[options='header']
[cols="15%,85%"]
|====================
| Parameters | Important points to note
| INDEX |
* `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed client list +
* `INDEX` must be a positive integer (ie. 1, 2, 3, ...)

|====================

==== Examples
Let’s say that you want to delete the client named "Alex Yeoh" in client list. You can simply use the `delete-c` command as shown.

. Type `delete-c 1` into the Command Box and press `Enter` to execute it.
+
image::ug-delete-1.png[]
. Result Box will display the message of the details of the deleted client. You can now see that the Client List no longer contains the deleted client.
+
image::ug-delete-2.png[]

==== Common errors/problems
You might face some errors or difficulties when you use `delete-c`. In this section, you will be able to understand these errors and resolve them.

===== No index specified
If you type in `delete-c` without specifying the `INDEX`, no client will be deleted and an error message will be shown.

image::ug-delete-3.png[]

This happens because there is no `INDEX` specified. To correct this, you have to enter a valid `INDEX` after `delete-c`.

===== Index out of range
If you key in an `INDEX` that is out of range, that is if there are only 4 clients in the list but you try to key in `delete-c 5`, no client will be deleted and an error message will be shown.

image::ug-delete-4.png[]

To correct this, you have to enter a valid `INDEX` that is not more than the number of clients in the client list.

=== View a client profile: `view-c` --- Li Zi Ying

You might want to view the complete information of a certain client in your client list. This complete information includes the client's full details, their exercise table and personal best table. `view-c INDEX` shows all available information of the client at the specified index.

==== Parameters
This section acts as a summary of the important things to note when using `view-c` including their parameters.

Format: `view-c INDEX`

[options='header']
[cols="15%,85%"]
|====================
| Parameters | Important points to note
| INDEX |
* `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed client list +
* `INDEX` must be a positive integer (ie. 1, 2, 3, ...)

|====================

==== Examples

Let’s say that you want to view the details of the client named "Alex Yeoh" in client list. You can simply use the `view-c` command as shown.

. Type `view-c 1` into the Command Box and press `Enter` to execute it.
+
image::ug-view-1.png[]
+
. Result Box will display the message telling you the client currently in view. You can now see that the Client View is now populated with the client's details, the exercise table and the personal best table.
+
image::ug-view-2.png[]

==== Common errors/problems
You might face some errors or difficulties when you use `view-c`. In this section, you will be able to understand these errors and resolve them.

===== No index specified
If you type in `view-c` without specifying the `INDEX`, no client will be viewed and an error message will be shown.

image::ug-view-3.png[]

This happens because there is no `INDEX` specified. To correct this, you have to enter a valid `INDEX` after `view-c`.

===== Index out of range
If you key in an `INDEX` that is out of range, that is if there are only 5 clients in the list but you try to key in `view-c 10`, no client will be viewed and an error message will be shown.

image::ug-delete-4.png[]

To correct this, you have to enter a valid `INDEX` that is not more than the number of clients in the client list.

=== Add a client's exercise: `add-e`  --- YongJie
`add-e` allows you to record an exercise done by the client that you are currently viewing. You will be able to see the exercises recorded and their information in the *Exercise Table*.

==== Parameters
This section acts as a summary of the important things to note when using `add-e` including their parameters. The square bracket shows that it is optional and your command will still execute even if you do not enter them.

Format: `add-e n/EXERCISE_NAME d/DATE [ew/EXERCISE_WEIGHT] [reps/REPS] [sets/SETS]`

[options='header']
[cols="15%,85%"]
|====================
| Parameters | Important points to note
| n/NAME |
* Substitute `NAME` with the name of the exercise. +

* `n/NAME` is compulsory and you have to specify it. +

* `n/NAME` is case sensitive. +
e.g. An exercise named `pushup` will be considered to have a different name as an exercise named `Pushup`.

| d/DATE |
* Substitute `DATE` with the date of the exercise. +

* `d/DATE` is compulsory and you have to specify it. +

* `DATE` must be of the form `DD-MM-YYYY` (ie. 02-07-2020 for 2nd July 2020)

* The range of `DATE` is from one year before the current date to the current date (inclusive).

| [reps/REPS] |
* Substitute `REPS` with the reps of the exercise. +

* `reps/REPS` is optional.

* Range for `REPS` is 1-9999. +

| [sets/SETS] |
* Substitute `SETS` with the sets of the exercise. +

* `sets/SETS` is optional.

* Range for `SETS` is 1-9999. +

| [ew/WEIGHT] |
* Substitute `Weight` with the weight of the exercise. +

* `ew/WEIGHT` is optional.

* Range for `WEIGHT` is 1-9999. +
|====================

==== Example
Let's say that you want to add an exercise with the following details: +
[width="50%"]
|============
Name: Bench Press +
Date: 12-02-2020 +
Reps: 4 +
Weight: 100 +
Sets: 4 +
|============
You can use the `add-e` command to add the exercise as shown.

. View the client that you want to add the exercise to. For information on how to view the client, you can refer to the `view-c` section. For this example, we will add the exercise to the first client in the list, `Alex Yeoh`. After you entered `view-c 1`, you will see `Alex Yeoh` detailed information and a table of his recorded exercises.
+
image::ug-addeExamplePart1.png[]
. Now type the information of the exercise, matching each detail of the exercise to the parameter. In this case, you will have to type `add-e n/Bench press d/12-02-2020 reps/4 ew/100 sets/4` into *Command Box*. Press enter to execute it. To recap,
+
[width="50%"]
|============
The name of the exercise after `n/` +
The date of the exercise after `d/` +
The reps of the exercise after `reps/` +
The weight of the exercise after `ew/` +
The sets of the exercise after `sets/` +
|============
image::ug-addeExamplePart2.png[]
. After it has been successfully entered, *Result Box* will display the recorded exercise. You will also be able to see the recorded exercise in the *Exercise Table*.
+
image::ug-addeExamplePart3.png[]

==== Common errors / problems
You might face some errors or difficulties when you use `add-e`. In this section, you will be able to understand these errors and resolve them.

===== Duplicate exercises
You might wonder why the application shows you a duplicate exercise error when the details of the exercises you entered are different. It is likely that only the sets differ between the two exercises. The example below might help you understand better.

You might have the following exercise in *Exercise Table*.

image::ug-addeDuplicatePart1.png[]

If you were to enter `add-e n/Bench Press d/12-02-2020 reps/4 ew/100 sets/2` into *Command Box*, the only information that is different is the number of sets.

image::ug-addeDuplicatePart2.png[]

*Result Box* will show that you have a duplicate exercise.

image::ug-addeDuplicatePart3.png[]

To solve this, we suggest incrementing the sets of the existing exercise by using the `edit-e` command. This will help to keep your exercises consolidated and the table compact. For information on using `edit-e`, you may want to refer to the next section `Edit a client's exercise: edit-e`.

=== Edit a client's exercise: `edit-e` --- YongJie
`edits-e` allows edit an existing exercise done by the client that you are currently viewing. You will be able to see the updated exercise in *Exercise Table*.

==== Parameters
This section acts as a summary of the important things to note when using `edit-e` including their parameters. The square bracket shows that it is optional and your command will still execute even if you do not enter them. However, at least one of them have to be specified.

Format: `edit-e INDEX [n/EXERCISE_NAME] [d/DATE] [ew/EXERCISE_WEIGHT] [reps/REPS] [sets/SETS]`

[options='header']
[cols="15%,85%"]
|====================
| Parameters | Important points to note
| INDEX |
* Substitute `INDEX` with the index of the exercise shown on the table. +

* `INDEX` is compulsory and you have to specify it. +

| n/NAME |
* Substitute `NAME` with the name of the exercise. +

* Substitute `Weight` with the weight of the exercise. +

* `ew/WEIGHT` is optional.

* Range for `WEIGHT` is 1-9999. +
|====================
==== Example
Let's say that you want to edit an exercise done by the client you are currently viewing. The exercise that you want to edit is the one highlighted in the photo below.

image::ug-editeExamplePart1.png[]

The exercise, "Bench Press", currently is 4 reps and weight of 100. However, they might be entered wrongly and you want to change the values. You can use the `edit-e` command to edit the exercise as shown.

. Identify the index of the exercise in *Exercise Table*. From the photo above, the index is 2. Type `edit-e 2 reps/8 ew/50` into *Command Box*. Press enter to execute it. To recap,
+
[width="50%"]
|============
The reps of the exercise after `reps/` +
The weight of the exercise after `ew/` +
|============
image::ug-editeExamplePart2.png[]
. After it has been successfully entered, *Result Box* will display a success message that the exercise has been edited. You will also be able to see the edited exercise in *Exercise Table*.
+
image::ug-editeExamplePart3.png[]

==== Common errors / problems
You might face some errors or difficulties when you use `edit-e`. In this section, you will be able to understand these errors and resolve them.

===== Duplicate exercises
You might wonder why the application shows you a duplicate exercise error when you do not have a duplicate of the edited exercise. It is likely that only the sets differ between the two exercises. The example below might help you understand better.

You might have the following exercise in *Exercise Table*.

image::ug-editeDuplicatePart1.png[]

If you were to enter `edit-e 2 n/Bench Press d/12-02-2020 reps/4 ew/100 sets/2` into *Command Box*, the only information that is different is the number of sets.

image::ug-editeDuplicatePart2.png[]

*Result Box* will show that you have a duplicate exercise.

image::ug-editeDuplicatePart3.png[]

To solve this, we suggest you delete the exercise you want to edit and increment the sets of the existing exercise by using the `edit-e` command. This will help to keep your exercises consolidated and the table compact.

=== Delete a client's exercise: `delete-e`

`delete-e` allows you to delete a previously recorded exercise of the client currently in view.

*Format*: `delete-e INDEX`

[NOTE]
This command can only be used when you have a client in view; make sure you know how to view a client first. Refer to <<view-c-command>> for more information.

[WARNING]
Deleting an exercise from FitBiz is permanent and *cannot be undone*.

==== Parameters

[options='header']
[cols="15%,85%"]
|===
| Parameters | Important points to note
| `INDEX` | Substitute `INDEX` with the actual index of the exercise shown on the *Exercise Table*

Must be a positive integer (eg. 1, 2, 3, ...)
|===

==== Example

. First, ensure that you are currently viewing a client by using the `view-c` command:
+
image::delete-e-1.png[]
. Say for example that you want to delete the fifth exercise found on the **Exercise Table** (the one named "Bench Press" done on "07-04-2020"), simply enter `delete-e 5`:
+
image::delete-e-2.png[]
. After the command has been successfully executed, the specified exercise should have been deleted. Notice also, in the *Personal Best Table* that the personal best for "Bench Press" has also been automatically updated to reflect this change:

==== Common errors/problems

If you find that you are unable to execute this command successfully, there are a few things you can check:

. Ensure that you are currently viewing a client using the `view-c` command. If you are indeed viewing a client, the *Client View* should not be empty.
. Ensure that you actually have exercises to delete and that the `INDEX` specified is correct. If the client does indeed have recorded exercises, the *Exercise List* should not be empty.

=== Schedule trainings for a client: `schedule`

Assigns weekly schedule timings to a client. The schedule will be displayed on the right panel of FitBiz, with the timings as well as the client's name. This command can assign multiple schedules to a client at once, by adding more arguments following the command.

Format: `schedule INDEX day/DAY st/STARTTIME et/ENDTIME`

* `INDEX` refers to the index number shown on the displayed client list
* `INDEX` must be a positive integer(ie. 1, 2, 3, ...)
* `INDEX` must be for an existing client index number
* `DAY` must be any one of the following values:
** MON
** TUE
** WED
** THU
** FRI
** SAT
** SUN
* `DAY` is not case-sensitive

=== Export as CSV: `export`

`export` allows you to export your client's recorded exercises into a spreadsheet format which you can then easily save or share with your clients. Note that this will create a CSV file, which you can then view and open in other programmes like Microsoft Excel, or Google Sheets (as shown in the example later).

[NOTE]
This command can only be used when you have a client in view; make sure you know how to view a client first. Refer to <<view-c-command>> for more information.

==== Quick summary

* Only the exercises of the current client in view will be exported
* Exported files will be saved in the `/exports` directory
* The name of the exported file will be the client's name followed by the `.csv` file extension (eg. `Alex Yeoh.csv`)

==== Example

. First, ensure that you are currently viewing a client by using the `view-c` command:
+
image::export-1.png[]
. Now, if the client you are viewing currently has recorded exercises, simply enter `export` into the *Command Box*
. If the success message shows, the file should also have been successfully exported:
+

. Now, simply use your favourite file explorer to locate the `exports` folder, which should be created at the same directory as `FitBiz.jar`. In the `exports` folder, you will then find your exported CSV file:
+

. If you have a spreadsheet software (like Microsoft Excel) installed on your computer, you can easily view the CSV file by launching it. In our example, we have https://support.google.com/docs/answer/40608?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en[imported it into Google Sheets] instead:

==== Common errors/problems

If you find that you are unable to execute this command successfully, there are a few things you can check:

. Ensure that you are currently viewing a client using the `view-c` command. If you are indeed viewing a client, the *Client View* should not be empty.
. Ensure that you actually do have exercises recorded for the client currently in view using the `add-e` command. If the client does indeed have recorded exercises, the *Exercise List* should not be empty.

=== Filter clients based on attribute: `filter-c` [Coming in v1.4]

Filters the client list by the specified keyword(s) that matches the name or any attributes the client has.

Format: `filter-c KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case insensitive. e.g `push ups` will match `Push Ups`
* The order of the keywords does not matter (e.g. `Push Pull` will match `Pull Push`)
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Push` will not match `Push Pull`
* Clients matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber, Bo Yang`

Examples:

* `filter-c Johnny`
** Returns a client list of `Johnny Tim` and `johnny`

=== Display visualisations of training progress: `graph` [Coming in v1.4]

Shows visualisations of a client’s exercise progress.

Format: `graph e/EXERCISE_NAME [s/START] [e/END]`

* Generates a graphical representation of the client’s progress
* If `START` or `END` is not specified, it will default to the current month
* Date format of `[s/START]`, `[e/END]` is `DD-MM-YYYY`
* This command can only be used while viewing a client (ie. right after `view-c` is used)

Examples:

* `graph e/Push Ups`
** Shows a graph of Ming Liang’s Push Ups progress over the current month

=== View schedule for the day/week: `view-s` [Coming in v2.0]

Shows the schedule for today or the time specified.

Format: `view-s TYPE`

* `TYPE` must be either `today`, `week` or `month`

Examples:

* `view schedule today`
** Shows the schedule for today
* `view schedule week`
** Shows the schedule of the current week
