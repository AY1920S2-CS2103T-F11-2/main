[[overview]]
== Overview

=== About FitBiz

FitBiz is a fitness business management tool tailor made for fitness coaches to manage their clients. From managing your client's profile to planning your schedules, FitBiz will surely ease the pain and monotony of managing a small to medium client portfolio.

This program is primarily a desktop application and is very optimised for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI). If you can type fast, and have clients to train and manage, FitBiz is definitely for you!

=== About this User Guide

This User Guide explains how to use FitBiz, as well as provides an understanding of the features and commands and some common use cases of this application.

In this guide, we cover:

* How to navigate the Graphical User Interface (GUI)
* How to use the Command Line Interface (CLI)
* Syntax of the commands available in FitBiz
* Common use cases for each command
* Common problems encountered by users

[[understanding-the-gui]]
=== Understanding the Graphical User Interface (GUI)

When you first launch FitBiz, you will be greeted by the GUI. In this section, we shall learn about what each section of this GUI is responsible for.

// diagram for hello world command box
.FitBiz GUI Layout
image::Ui-annotated.png[]

* **Command Box**: this is where you enter your commands
** Note that the border will glow green if your command is successfully executed, and red otherwise
* **Result Box**: this displays feedback and other useful information about your commands that you have just entered
* **Client List**: this displays all your clients currently recorded in FitBiz
* **Schedule Panel**: this displays all your schedules of your clients
* **Client View**: this displays all the important details about the client you are currently viewing (which we refer to as _client in view_). In here, we have 3 further sections:
** **Client Details**: this displays other information about your client that is otherwise not found in **Client List**
** **Exercise Table**: this displays all the exercises recorded for the current _client in view_
** **Personal Best Table**: this displays the personal bests of the exercises done by the current _client in view_

[TIP]
If this is your first time using FitBiz and you have just started up the application, you may realise that the *Client View* section is missing. This is because you are currently not viewing a client. Refer to <<view-c-command>> for more information about what you need to do.

// tag::understanding-the-cli[]
[[understanding-the-cli]]
=== Understanding the Command Line Interface (CLI) --- Aaron Choo

Even though FitBiz comes with a GUI, it is mainly used to display data. Most of the user interaction occurs via the CLI, which in FitBiz, is comprised of the *Command Box* and the *Result Box*. We understand that CLIs have higher barriers to entry and may scare some inexperienced users away. As such, we have provided some features common to most modern CLIs to make your user experience with FitBiz much better. In this section, we shall look at the **Command History** and the **Command Autocomplete** feature, and learn how to effectively utilise them.

[[command-history]]
==== Command History

Similar to most modern CLIs, users of FitBiz can press the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] arrow keys to cycle through their previously entered commands. If you have prior experience in using a CLI, feel free to skip this section as this should be second nature to you. If not, here is a quick tutorial on how to use this time saving feature.

First, start by typing anything into the *Command Box*. It _need not_ have to be a valid command (like those shown in <<Commands>>). In our example, we chose to type `Hello World`:

// diagram for hello world command box
image::command-history-hello-world.png[]

Next, hit the kbd:[Enter] key to enter the command into FitBiz. Notice that whatever you have typed in the *Command Box* should have disappeared. If you did not enter a valid command (like `Hello World`), the border of the *Command Box* would have turned red, and you would have been prompted by a message saying `Unknown command` in the *Result Box* like shown:

// diagram for invalid command
image::command-history-unknown-command.png[]

Next, continue entering different commands into the *Command Box*. You can safely ignore all the `Unknown command` prompts for now.

Once you feel like you have entered enough commands into FitBiz, try hitting the kbd:[&uarr;] key several times. You should start to see the history of your entered commands displaying in the *Command Box* in reverse chronological order. If you press the kbd:[&uarr;] key enough times (or simply hold down the key), you would realise that the command in the *Command Box* no longer changes. In our case, it displays `Hello World`, our first ever entered command.

Likewise, you can also see your more recent commands by pressing the kbd:[&darr;] key. Again, if you press it enough times, you would realise that the text from the *Command Box* disappeares (right after displaying your most recent command). This means that you have reached the end of your command history.

[TIP]
If you are not currently browsing the history, you can press the kbd:[&darr;] key to immediately clear what you are currently typing in the *Command Box*.

[[command-autocomplete]]
==== Command Autocomplete

Again, similar to most modern CLIs, users of FitBiz can press the kbd:[Tab] key to autocomplete commands that they have partially typed. If the partially typed letters uniquely identifies a valid command in FitBiz (see <<Commands>>), the complete command will automatically appear in the *Command Box*. Otherwise, a list of all commands similar to the ambiguous letters will appear in the *Result Box*.

Also, we understand that some of FitBiz's commands may be particularly long and diffcult to remember. In order to remedy this, we have also provided *autocompletion of parameter prefixes* for some commands, as well as the *use of kbd:[Tab] to easily get to the next prefix*. When autocompleting commands, the caret position will also be automatically set to the most optimal position corresponding to the completed command.

To see this feature in action, type `add-c` into the *Command Box* and press kbd:[Tab]:

image::autocomplete-1.png[]

Immediately, you should have noticed three things:

. All the parameter prefixes pertaining to the `add-c` command have been automatically completed for you
. Your caret is placed right after the `n/` for you to type your parameter
. The **Result Box** shows you the usage of the `add-c` command

Now, you can also press the kbd:[Tab] key repeatedly to go to the next parameter prefix, instead of wasting time using your mouse.

Note however, that there are some similar commands in FitBiz that have the same few starting letters. For example: both `add-c` and `add-e` starts with the letter "a". As such, hitting kbd:[Tab] when you have only typed `a` in the *Command Box* will not autocomplete either command (unfortunately, FitBiz cannot read your mind). However, you will find that the command will be completed up till `add-`, the point where `add-e` and `add-c` differs. The **Result Box** will also prompt you with the list of all similar commands found:

image::autocomplete-2.png[]

To autocomplete the parameter prefixes like in the first example above, you would just have to complete the command and press kbd:[Tab] once more.

[TIP]
Commands and their parameters in FitBiz are always separated by white spaces (ie. ``schedule 1 sch/``). As such, the kbd:[Tab] key will only try to autocomplete your command if your current input in the *Command Box* is a single word. In other words, if your input is made up of more than one word separated by white spaces, FitBiz will ignore your use of kbd:[Tab]. Do not be surprised when you try to autocomplete more than a single word like `add some thing`, and yet receive no response from FitBiz.

[NOTE]
The autocompletion of the parameter prefixes are only for these commands: `add-c`, `add-e`, `filter-c`, `graph`, and `schedule`. Autocompletion of prefixes for edit commands are not included as we understand that most likely than not, users would only choose to edit one field at a time.

// end::understanding-the-cli[]

== Quick Start

. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer
. Download the latest `FitBiz.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here]
. Move the `FitBiz.jar` file to the folder you want to use as the home folder of this application (to reduce clutter, an empty folder is recommended as files will be generated)
. Double-click the file to start the app. The following GUI should appear in a few seconds:
+
image::Ui.png[]
. Type the command in the *Command Box* and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it
** For example, executing the `help` command will lead you to this page

====
* Refer to the <<understanding-the-gui, GUI>> and <<understanding-the-cli, CLI>> guides if you need help navigating this application
* Refer to <<Commands>> for the details and syntax of each command
====

== Commands

This section introduces the syntax and the usages of the commands available in FitBiz. In explaining the syntax, we will adhere to the following format:

* Words in `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user
** e.g. in `add-c n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add-c n/John Doe`
* Items in square brackets are optional
** e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`
* Items with `â€¦` after them can be used multiple times including zero times
** e.g. `[t/TAG]â€¦` can be used as (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order
** e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable

=== View help: `help`

Entering `help` into FitBiz will bring you right here! ðŸ˜¬

=== List all clients: `list-c`

Shows all clients currently entered in this program.

* Note that this is the default view when you first launch FitBiz

Format: `list-c`

=== Find clients by name: `find-c` --- Yong Jie
`find-c` allows you to find clients with the names that are specified in your input. You might have many clients and finding a particular client by scrolling through the entire *Client List* might be troublesome and difficult. `find-c` is the command for you.

==== Parameters
This section acts as a summary of the important things to note when using `find-c` including their parameters.

Format: `find-c NAME...`

[options='header']
[cols="15%,85%"]
|====================
| Parameters | Important points to note
| NAME |
* Substitute `NAME` with keywords you want to search with +

* You can use multiple keywords for `NAME`. +
e.g. You can enter `find-c bryan low`.

* The `NAME` keywords are case insensitive. +
e.g. Typing `find-c hans` will show clients even with the name `Hans`. +
For a better understanding, you can refer to the example section .

* The keywords used for `NAME` have to match at least one word in the name of the clients. +
e.g. Typing `find-c Bry` will not show clients with the name `Bryan`. +
For a detailed explanation, you can refer to the commons errors / problems section.

* Clients matching at least one `NAME` keyword will be returned and does not require all the words in their name to match. +
e.g. Typing `find-c Hans Bo` will show clients `Hans Gruber` and `Bo Yang` and not necessarily just client `Hans Bo`. +
For a detailed explanation, you can refer to the commons errors / problems section.
|====================

==== Example
Let's say that you want to find a client named "Bryan Low" in *Client List*. You can simply use the `find-c` command as shown.

. Type `find-c bryan` into *Command Box*, and press `Enter` to execute it.
+
image::ug-findcExamplePart1.png[]

. *Result Box* will display the message of the number of clients listed. In this case, there are 2 clients with "bryan" in their name.
+
image::ug-findcExamplePart2.png[]

. You can now see the clients with "bryan" in their names. As you can see, the name you use to search does not need to be case-senstive. The client that we are looking for "Bryan Low" is in *Client List*.
+
image::ug-findcExamplePart3.png[]

==== Common errors / problems
You might face some errors or difficulties when you `find-c`. In this section, you will be able to understand these errors and resolve them. You will also get a better understanding of the reply from the result box when using `find-c`.

===== Using incomplete names
You might wonder why `find-c` do not show the clients even though the client is clearly in your client list records. It might be possible that you have entered an incomplete name and does not match any word in the name of that client. The example below might help you understand better.

Example:
You want to find the client named "Bryan Low" in *Client List*. Below shows that "Bryan Low" indeed exists and is recorded.

image::ug-findcIncompleteNamePart1.png[]

Type `find-c bry` into *Command Box*, and press `Enter` to execute it.

image::ug-findcIncompleteNamePart2.png[]

You will obtain "0 clients listed!" in *Result Box*.

image::ug-findcIncompleteNamePart3.png[]

This is because the name that you have entered is incomplete and does not match any word in the name of any of the clients. To correct this, you have to enter `find-c bryan` as seen in the example.

===== Using multiple keywords for `NAME`

You might wonder why the application shows more clients than you intended. It might be possible that you have misunderstood how the `NAME` parameter gets the client you are finding. The application will show clients as long as one of the words of the client match a keyword you use for name. The example below might help you understand better.

Example:
You want to find the client named "Bryan Low" in *Client List*.

Type `find-c bryan low` in to *Command Box*, and press `Enter` to execute it.

image::ug-findcMultiplePart1.png[]

You will obtain clients which have `bryan` in their name or `low` in the name. In the case below, there are 3 clients. `Bryan Low`, `Bryan Tan` and `Alice Low`.

image::ug-findcMultiplePart2.png[]

You can try to enter keywords for `NAME` that are more specific to the client you are looking for. This will help to keep your search more scoped.

// tag::add-c-command[]

=== Add a new client profile: `add-c` --- Toh Ker Wei
After setting up the program, the first thing you might want to do is to add your client to FitBiz. You can do so by using the `add-c` command, followed by the details of your client.

==== Common errors/ problems:
If you are facing errors or difficulty adding a client, you can refer to the common errors and problems listed below and resolve your error using the solution given.

. *Compulsory fields missing*
+
If you are adding a client and miss out any of the compulsory parameters. You will not be able to add the client.
+
For example, when you want to add a `Rachel Tan` into FitBiz but did not include the compulsory field `a/ADDRESS`
+
image::AddNoAddress.png[]
+
Afterpressing enter, the following error message will be shown.
+
image::AddNoAddressError.png[]
+
To solve this error, ensure that all compulsory parameters are included when adding a client. The compulsory parameters include: `n/NAME`, `p/PHONE`, `e/EMAIl` and `a/ADDRESS`. To continue with the same example, the command will now include Rachel's address.
+

The result of successfully adding Rachel will show the following
+
image::AddAddressSuccess.png[]
+
. *Adding clients with the same phone number or email*

In FitBiz, you cannot add 2 clients with the either same phone number or email.

For example, you have client with the email `RachelTan@dmail.com` and you want to add another client with the same email.

image::AddSameEmailCommand.png[]

The following error message will be shown.

image::AddSameEmailError.png[]

To solve this issue, ensure that any new client you add does not have the same phone number or email as existing client.

// end::add-c-command[]

=== Edit a clientâ€™s profile: `edit-c`

Edits the clientâ€™s cliental details by specifying the attribute and the new value.

Format: `edit-c INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [g/GENDER] [h/HEIGHT] [cw/CURRENT_WEIGHT] [tw/TARGET_WEIGHT] [r/REMARK] [s/SPORT]â€¦ [t/TAG]...`

* `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed client list

=== Delete a client: `delete-c` --- Li Zi Ying

You find that your client list contains a client who is no longer working with you and you would like to remove his details from your client list. `delete-c` allows you to delete the client at the specified index from your list of clients.

==== Parameters
This section acts as a summary of the important things to note when using `delete-c` including their parameters.

Format: `delete-c INDEX`

[options='header']
[cols="15%,85%"]
|====================
| Parameters | Important points to note
| INDEX |
`INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed client list +

`INDEX` must be a positive integer (ie. 1, 2, 3, ...) +
|====================

==== Examples
Letâ€™s say that you want to delete the client named "Alex Yeoh" in client list. You can simply use the `delete-c` command as shown.

. Type `delete-c 1` into the Command Box and press `Enter` to execute it.
+
image::ug-delete-1.png[]

+
image::ug-delete-2.png[]

==== Common errors/problems
You might face some errors or difficulties when you use `delete-c`. In this section, you will be able to understand these errors and resolve them.

===== No index specified
If you type in `delete-c` without specifying the `INDEX`, no client will be deleted and an error message will be shown.

image::ug-delete-3.png[]

This happens because there is no `INDEX` specified. To correct this, you have to enter a valid `INDEX` after `delete-c`.

===== Index out of range
If you key in an `INDEX` that is out of range, that is if there are only 4 clients in the list but you try to key in `delete-c 5`, no client will be deleted and an error message will be shown.

image::ug-delete-4.png[]

To correct this, you have to enter a valid `INDEX` that is not more than the number of clients in the client list.

=== View a client profile: `view-c` --- Li Zi Ying

You might want to view the complete information of a certain client in your client list. This complete information includes the client's full details, their exercise table and personal best table. `view-c INDEX` shows all available information of the client at the specified index.

[width="50%"]
|============
Name: Bench Press +
Date: 12-02-2020 +
Reps: 4 +
Weight: 100 +
Sets: 4 +
|============
You can use the `add-e` command to add the exercise as shown.

. View the client that you want to add the exercise to. For information on how to view the client, you can refer to the `view-c` section. For this example, we will add the exercise to the first client in the list, `Alex Yeoh`. After you entered `view-c 1`, you will see `Alex Yeoh` detailed information and a table of his recorded exercises.
+
image::ug-addeExamplePart1.png[]
. Now type the information of the exercise, matching each detail of the exercise to the parameter. In this case, you will have to type `add-e n/Bench press d/12-02-2020 reps/4 ew/100 sets/4` into *Command Box*. Press enter to execute it. To recap,
+
[width="50%"]
|============
The name of the exercise after `n/` +
The date of the exercise after `d/` +
The reps of the exercise after `reps/` +
The weight of the exercise after `ew/` +
The sets of the exercise after `sets/` +
|============
image::ug-addeExamplePart2.png[]
. After it has been successfully entered, *Result Box* will display the recorded exercise. You will also be able to see the recorded exercise in the *Exercise Table*.
+
image::ug-addeExamplePart3.png[]

==== Common errors / problems
You might face some errors or difficulties when you use `add-e`. In this section, you will be able to understand these errors and resolve them.

===== Duplicate exercises
You might wonder why the application shows you a duplicate exercise error when the details of the exercises you entered are different. It is likely that only the sets differ between the two exercises. The example below might help you understand better.

You might have the following exercise in *Exercise Table*.

image::ug-addeDuplicatePart1.png[]

If you were to enter `add-e n/Bench Press d/12-02-2020 reps/4 ew/100 sets/2` into *Command Box*, the only information that is different is the number of sets.

image::ug-addeDuplicatePart2.png[]

*Result Box* will show that you have a duplicate exercise.

image::ug-addeDuplicatePart3.png[]

To solve this, we suggest incrementing the sets of the existing exercise by using the `edit-e` command. This will help to keep your exercises consolidated and the table compact. For information on using `edit-e`, you may want to refer to the next section `Edit a client's exercise: edit-e`.

=== Edit a client's exercise: `edit-e` --- YongJie
`edits-e` allows edit an existing exercise done by the client that you are currently viewing. You will be able to see the updated exercise in *Exercise Table*.

==== Parameters
This section acts as a summary of the important things to note when using `edit-e` including their parameters. The square bracket shows that it is optional and your command will still execute even if you do not enter them. However, at least one of them have to be specified.

Format: `edit-e INDEX [n/EXERCISE_NAME] [d/DATE] [ew/EXERCISE_WEIGHT] [reps/REPS] [sets/SETS]`

[options='header']
[cols="15%,85%"]
|====================
| Parameters | Important points to note
| INDEX |
* Substitute `INDEX` with the index of the exercise shown on the table. +

* `INDEX` is compulsory and you have to specify it. +

| n/NAME |
* Substitute `NAME` with the name of the exercise. +

* `n/NAME` is optional. +

* `n/NAME` is case sensitive. +
e.g. An exercise named `pushup` will be considered to have a different name as an exercise named `Pushup`.

| d/DATE |
* Substitute `DATE` with the date of the exercise. +

* `d/DATE` is optional. +

* `DATE` must be of the form `DD-MM-YYYY` (ie. 02-07-2020 for 2nd July 2020) +

* The range of `DATE` is from one year before the current date to the current date (inclusive).

| [reps/REPS] |
* Substitute `REPS` with the reps of the exercise. +

* `reps/REPS` is optional.

* Range for `REPS` is 1-9999. +

| [sets/SETS] |
* Substitute `SETS` with the sets of the exercise. +

* `sets/SETS` is optional.

* Range for `SETS` is 1-9999. +

| [ew/WEIGHT] |
* Substitute `Weight` with the weight of the exercise. +

* `ew/WEIGHT` is optional.

* Range for `WEIGHT` is 1-9999. +
|====================
==== Example
Let's say that you want to edit an exercise done by the client you are currently viewing. The exercise that you want to edit is the one highlighted in the photo below.

image::ug-editeExamplePart1.png[]

The exercise, "Bench Press", currently is 4 reps and weight of 100. However, they might be entered wrongly and you want to change the values. You can use the `edit-e` command to edit the exercise as shown.

. Identify the index of the exercise in *Exercise Table*. From the photo above, the index is 2. Type `edit-e 2 reps/8 ew/50` into *Command Box*. Press enter to execute it. To recap,
+
[width="50%"]
|============
The reps of the exercise after `reps/` +
The weight of the exercise after `ew/` +
|============
image::ug-editeExamplePart2.png[]
. After it has been successfully entered, *Result Box* will display a success message that the exercise has been edited. You will also be able to see the edited exercise in *Exercise Table*.
+
image::ug-editeExamplePart3.png[]

==== Common errors / problems
You might face some errors or difficulties when you use `edit-e`. In this section, you will be able to understand these errors and resolve them.

===== Duplicate exercises
You might wonder why the application shows you a duplicate exercise error when you do not have a duplicate of the edited exercise. It is likely that only the sets differ between the two exercises. The example below might help you understand better.

You might have the following exercise in *Exercise Table*.

image::ug-editeDuplicatePart1.png[]

If you were to enter `edit-e 2 n/Bench Press d/12-02-2020 reps/4 ew/100 sets/2` into *Command Box*, the only information that is different is the number of sets.

image::ug-editeDuplicatePart2.png[]

*Result Box* will show that you have a duplicate exercise.

image::ug-editeDuplicatePart3.png[]

To solve this, we suggest you delete the exercise you want to edit and increment the sets of the existing exercise by using the `edit-e` command. This will help to keep your exercises consolidated and the table compact.

// tag::delete-e-command[]

=== Delete a client's exercise: `delete-e` --- Aaron Choo

`delete-e` allows you to delete a previously recorded exercise of the client currently in view.

*Format*: `delete-e INDEX`

[NOTE]
This command can only be used when you have a client in view; make sure you know how to view a client first. Refer to <<view-c-command>> for more information.

[WARNING]
Deleting an exercise from FitBiz is permanent and *cannot be undone*.

==== Parameters

[options='header']
[cols="15%,85%"]
|===
| Parameters | Important points to note
| `INDEX` | Substitute `INDEX` with the actual index of the exercise shown on the *Exercise Table*

Must be a positive integer (eg. 1, 2, 3, ...)
|===

==== Example

. First, ensure that you are currently viewing a client by using the `view-c` command:
+
image::delete-e-1.png[]
. Say for example that you want to delete the fifth exercise found on the **Exercise Table** (the one named "Bench Press" done on "07-04-2020"), simply enter `delete-e 5`:
+
image::delete-e-2.png[]
. After the command has been successfully executed, the specified exercise should have been deleted. Notice also, in the *Personal Best Table* that the personal best for "Bench Press" has also been automatically updated to reflect this change:
+
image::delete-e-3.png[]

==== Common errors/problems

If you find that you are unable to execute this command successfully, there are a few things you can check:

. Ensure that you are currently viewing a client using the `view-c` command. If you are indeed viewing a client, the *Client View* should not be empty.
. Ensure that you actually have exercises to delete and that the `INDEX` specified is correct. If the client does indeed have recorded exercises, the *Exercise Table* should not be empty.

// end::delete-e-command[]

=== Schedule trainings for a client: `schedule`

Assigns weekly schedule timings to a client. The schedule will be displayed on the right panel of FitBiz, with the timings as well as the client's name. This command can assign multiple schedules to a client at once, by adding more arguments following the command.

Format: `schedule INDEX day/DAY st/STARTTIME et/ENDTIME`

* `INDEX` refers to the index number shown on the displayed client list
* `INDEX` must be a positive integer(ie. 1, 2, 3, ...)
* `INDEX` must be for an existing client index number
* `DAY` must be any one of the following values:
** MON
** TUE
** WED
** THU
** FRI
** SAT
** SUN
* `DAY` is not case-sensitive

// tag::export-command[]
[[export-command]]
=== Export a client's exercises to CSV format: `export` --- Aaron Choo

`export` allows you to export your client's recorded exercises into a spreadsheet format which you can then easily save or share with your clients. Note that this will create a CSV file, which you can view and open in other applications like Microsoft Excel, or Google Sheets (as shown in the example later).

[NOTE]
This command can only be used when you have a client in view; make sure you know how to view a client first. Refer to <<view-c-command>> for more information.

==== Quick summary

* Only the exercises of the current client in view will be exported
* Exported files will be saved in the `/exports` directory
* The name of the exported file will be the client's name followed by the `.csv` file extension (eg. `Alex Yeoh.csv`)

==== Example

. First, ensure that you are currently viewing a client by using the `view-c` command:
+
image::export-1.png[]
. Now, if the client you are viewing currently has recorded exercises in the *Exercise Table*, simply execute the `export` command
. The exercises should have been successfully exported, if the following success message is shown:
+
image::export-2.png[]
. Now, simply use your favourite file explorer to locate the `exports` folder, which should be created in the same directory as `FitBiz.jar`. In the `exports` folder, you will then find your exported CSV file:
+
image::export-3.png[]
. If you have a spreadsheet software (like Microsoft Excel) installed on your computer, you can easily view the CSV file by launching it. In our example, we have https://support.google.com/docs/answer/40608?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en[imported it into Google Sheets] instead:
+
image::export-4.png[]

==== Common errors/problems

If you find that you are unable to execute this command successfully, there are a few things you can check:

. Ensure that you are currently viewing a client using the `view-c` command. If you are indeed viewing a client, the *Client View* should not be empty.
. Ensure that you actually do have exercises recorded for the client currently in view using the `add-e` command. If the client does indeed have recorded exercises, the *Exercise Table* should not be empty.

=== Filter clients based on attribute: `filter-c` --- Toh Ker Wei

When you have many clients and want to filter the list of clients to view a specific group, you can use the command `filter-c` to filter clients based on their tags or their sports.

==== Format
Format: `filter-c [t/TAG]... [s/SPORT]...

[options='header']
[cols= "15%,85%"]
|===
|Parameter | Important notes
| `t/TAG` | `TAG` is the tag of the clients you want to match and list. +

`TAG` is case-insensitive. +
e.g. `healthy` will match `Healthy`

`TAG` should only contain letters or numbers. +
e.g. `monday` or `obese200kg`

|`s/SPORT` | `SPORT` is the sport of the clients you want to match and list. +

`SPORT` is case-insensitive. +
e.g.  `track and field` returns the same result as `Track And Field`

`SPORT` should only contain letters, numbers or spaces.
e.g. `sumo wrestling` or `100m sprint`

Order of words in `SPORT` does not matter
e.g. `track and field` returns the same result as `field and track`
|===

==== Example

Let's say you want to filter through your list of clients and only display those with the tag `healthy` and play the sport `badminton`.

. Type the command `filter-c t/healthy s/badminton` into the command box.
+
image::FilterExampleCommand.png[]
+
. Press enter to execute.
+
. The clients with the matching tag and sport will be displayed as shown.

image::FilterExampleSuccess.png[]

==== Common error/ problem
*Tags with spaces*

When you want to filter the clients list with multiple tags like `healthy` and `sporty`, you might enter the command shown below.

image::FilterTagCommand.png[]

You will then encounter the error `Tags names should be alphanumeric`.

image::FilterTagError.png[]

This error occurs because `TAG` only accepts letters and numbers but not spaces. To solve the problem, add an additional delimiter for each tag you want to specify. Note that sports does not require multiple delimiter.

image::FilterTagCorrectCommand.png[]

The list of successfully filter clients will then be displayed.

image::FilterTagSuccess.png[]

// end::filter-c-command[]

=== Display visualisations of training progress: `graph` --- Li Zi Ying

`graph` allows you to see a graphical visualisation of a clientâ€™s exercise progress within a specified timeframe, so that you can easily track your client's progress and improvement.

==== Parameters

This section acts as a summary of important things to note when using `graph` including their parameters.

Format: `n/EXERCISE_NAME a/Y_AXIS sd/START_DATE ed/END_DATE`

[options='header']
[cols="15%,85%"]
|====================
| Parameters | Important points to note
| n/EXERCISE_NAME |
Substitute `EXERCISE_NAME` with the name of the exercise. +

`n/EXERCISE_NAME` is compulsory and you have to specify it. +

`n/EXERCISE_NAME` is case sensitive. +
e.g. An exercise `pushup` will be considered to be different from the exercise `Pushup`.

| a/Y_AXIS |
Substitute `Y_AXIS` with the y-axis of your choice. +

`Y_AXIS` is compulsory and you have to specify it. +

`Y_AXIS` must either be `reps` or `weight` (case insensitive), allowing you to specify the exercise attribute you wish to focus on +
e.g. `Reps`, `weigHt` and `WEIGHT` will be valid inputs for `Y_AXIS`. +

| sd/START_DATE |
Substitute `START_DATE` with the start date of your graph. +

`sd/START_DATE` is compulsory and you have to specify it. +

`START_DATE` must be of the form `DD-MM-YYYY` (ie. 02-07-2020 for 2nd July 2020) +

The range of `START_DATE` is from one year before the current date to the current date (inclusive). +

`START_DATE` cannot be chronologically after `END_DATE` +

| ed/END_DATE |
Substitute `END_DATE` with the end date of your graph +

`ed/END_DATE` is compulsory and you have to specify it. +

`END_DATE` must be of the form `DD-MM-YYYY` (ie. 02-07-2020 for 2nd July 2020) +

The range of `END_DATE` is from one year before the current date to the current date (inclusive). +

`END_DATE` cannot be chronologically before `START_DATE` +
|====================

==== Example

Let's say that you wish to view the exercise graph of `Alex Yeoh` for the exercise `Sumo Deadlift` from the date `01-01-2020` to `13-04-2020` and you want to focus on the `weight` he lifted during the exercise.

You can use the `graph` command to view the graph of the exercise following the steps as shown:

. First view the client that you want to view the exercise graph of. For information on how to view the client, you can refer to the `view-c` section. For this example, we will view the graph of `Alex Yeoh`, who is the first client in the client list. After entering `view-c 1`, you will see the full detailed information and a table of recorded exercises of client `Alex Yeoh`.
+
image::ug-graph-1.png[]
. Next, simply type the graph command `graph n/Sumo Deadlift a/weight sd/01-01-2020 ed/13-04-2020` into the Command Box.
+
image::ug-graph-2.png[]
. The graph will appear separately in a window.
+
image::ug-graph-3.png[]
. You will see the Result Box informing you of the current graph displayed. Note that any changes made using `add-e, edit-e, delete-e` will not be reflected in the graph.
+
image::ug-graph-4.png[]

==== Common errors/problems
You might face some errors or difficulties when you use `graph`. In this section, you will be able to understand these errors and resolve them. You will also get a better understanding of the reply from the Result Box when using `graph`.

===== No exercise within stipulated timeframe
If you have keyed in the `graph` command in the correct format but the graph is not appearing, you might want to check the start and end dates in your command. In the example below, the exercise clearly exists in the exercise list, but not within the stipuated timeframe. Therefore the graph will not be displayed.

. The exercise `Sumo Deadlift` clearly exists in the exercise list. However, there are no records of `Sumo Deadlifts` from `01-01-2020` to `01-02-2020`.
+
image::ug-graph-5.png[]
. The graph will not appear and an error message will be shown.
+
image::ug-graph-6.png[]

To correct this, change the timeframe to one where there is at least one existing record of the specified exercise in the current exercise list.

===== No exercise for stipulated axis

If you have keyed in the `graph` command in the correct format but the graph is not appearing, you might want to check the y-axis in your command. In the example below, the exercise clearly exists in the exercise list, but there are no inputs for the stipulated y-axis. Therefore the graph will not be displayed.

. The exercise `Push Up` clearly exists in the given timeframe. However, there are no inputs for weight as seen in the exercise table.
+
image::ug-graph-7.png[]
. The graph will not appear and an error message will be shown.
+
image::ug-graph-8.png[]

To correct this, change the axis to one where there is at least one non-empty input of the  exercise in the current exercise list. You could also choose to view another exercise's graph instead.

===== Invalid time frame

If you have keyed in the `graph` command in the command box but the graph is not appearing, you might want to check the start and end dates. In the example below, the command format looks correct but the start date is later than the end date. This is not allowed and therefore the graph will not be displayed.

. The start date `01-04-2020` is chronologically later than the end date `01-02-2020`.
+
image::ug-graph-9.png[]
. The graph will not appear and an error message will be shown.
+
image::ug-graph-10.png[]

To correct this, the start date has to be earlier or the same as the end date.

=== View schedule for the day/week: `view-s` [Coming in v2.0]
