== Overview

=== About FitBiz

FitBiz is a business management tool tailor made for fitness coaches to manage their clients. From managing your client's profile to planning your schedules, FitBiz will surely ease the pain and monotony of managing a small to medium client portfolio.

This program is primarily a desktop application and optimised for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI). If you can type fast, and have clients to train and manage, FitBiz is definitely for you!

=== About this User Guide

This User Guide explains how to use the FitBiz CLI, as well as provides an understanding of the features and commands and some common use cases.

In this guide, we cover:

* Syntax of the commands available in FitBiz
* Common use cases for each command

=== Miscellaneous Features

As this is primarily a CLI based application, some features are included to make the user experience better. The following features are provided to simplify the use of FitBiz:

* Command History: similar to most modern CLIs, users can press the kbd:[Up] and kbd:[Down] arrow key to cycle through their previously entered commands. This history is persisted in the storage, allowing users to quickly reference what they have entered in a previous usage of this app.
* Command Auto Completion: again, similar to most modern CLIs, users can press the kbd:[Tab] key to auto complete the commands that they have partially typed. If the partially typed letters begin a string that uniquely identifies a command, the complete command name appears. Otherwise, a list of all commands similar to the ambiguous letters will appear.

== Quick Start

. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer
. Download the latest `FitBiz.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here]
. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Fitness Manager
. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds
. Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. e.g. typing `help` and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
. Some example commands you can try:
* `list-c` : lists all clients
* `add-c n/John Doe g/Male p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 b/24-12-1997 h/170 cw/70 tw/75`
: adds a client named John Doe to FitBiz
* `exit` : exits the app
. Refer to <<Commands>> below for details of each command

== Commands

This section introduces the syntax and the usages of the commands available in FitBiz. In explaining the syntax, we will adhere to the following format:

* Words in `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user
** e.g. in `add-c n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add-c n/John Doe`
* Items in square brackets are optional
** e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`
* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times
** e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order
** e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable

=== View help: `help`

Opens a window with the link to the User Guide. `Currently in v1.3`
Lists all available commands and a short description of what they do. Specify the command for more detailed explanation. `Coming in v1.4`

Format: `help [c/COMMAND]`

Examples:

* `help`
** Lists all commands
* `help add-c`
** Shows a detailed explanation of the `add-c` command

=== List all clients: `list-c`

Shows all clients currently entered in this program.

* Note that this is the default view when you first launch FitBiz

Format: `list-c`

=== Find clients by name: `find-c` --- Yong Jie
`find-c` allows you to find clients with the names that are specified in your input. You might have many clients and finding a particular client by scrolling through the entire *Client List* might be troublesome and difficult. `find-c` is the command for you.

==== Parameters
This section acts as a summary of the important things to note when using `find-c` including their parameters.

Format: `find-c NAME`

[options='header']
[cols="15%,85%"]
|====================
| Parameters | Important points to note
| NAME |
* Substitute `NAME` with keywords you want to search with +

* You can use multiple keywords for `NAME`. +
e.g. You can enter `find-c bryan low`.

* The `NAME` keywords are case insensitive. +
e.g. Typing `find-c hans` will show clients even with the name `Hans`. +
For a better understanding, you can refer to the example section .

* The keywords used for `NAME` have to match at least one word in the name of the clients. +
e.g. Typing `find-c Bry` will not show clients with the name `Bryan`. +
For a detailed explanation, you can refer to the commons errors / problems section.

* Clients matching at least one `NAME` keyword will be returned and does not require all the words in their name to match. +
e.g. Typing `find-c Hans Bo` will show clients `Hans Gruber` and `Bo Yang` and not necessarily just client `Hans Bo`. +
For a detailed explanation, you can refer to the commons errors / problems section.
|====================

==== Example
Let's say that you want to find a client named "Bryan Low" in *Client List*. You can simply use the `find-c` command as shown.

1.Type `find-c bryan` into *Command Box*, and press `Enter` to execute it.

image::ug-findcExamplePart1.png[]

2.*Result Box* will display the message of the number of clients listed. In this case, there are 2 clients with "bryan" in their name.

image::ug-findcExamplePart2.png[]

3.You can now see the clients with "bryan" in their names. As you can see, the name you use to search does not need to be case-senstive. The client that we are looking for "Bryan Low" is in *Client List*.

image::ug-findcExamplePart3.png[]

==== Common errors / problems
You might face some errors or difficulties when you `find-c`. In this section, you will be able to understand these errors and resolve them. You will also get a better understanding of the reply from the result box when using `find-c`.

===== Using incomplete names
You might wonder why `find-c` do not show the clients even though the client is clearly in your client list records. It might be possible that you have entered an incomplete name and does not match any word in the name of that client. The example below might help you understand better.

Example:
You want to find the client named "Bryan Low" in *Client List*. Below shows that "Bryan Low" indeed exists and is recorded.

image::ug-findcIncompleteNamePart1.png[]

Type `find-c bry` into *Command Box*, and press `Enter` to execute it.

image::ug-findcIncompleteNamePart2.png[]

You will obtain "0 clients listed!" in *Result Box*.

image::ug-findcIncompleteNamePart3.png[]

This is because the name that you have entered is incomplete and does not match any word in the name of any of the clients. To correct this, you have to enter `find-c bryan` as seen in the example.

===== Using multiple keywords for `NAME`

You might wonder why the application shows more clients than you intended. It might be possible that you have misunderstood how the `NAME` parameter gets the client you are finding. The application will show clients as long as one of the words of the client match a keyword you use for name. The example below might help you understand better.

Example:
You want to find the client named "Bryan Low" in *Client List*.

Type `find-c bryan low` in to *Command Box*, and press `Enter` to execute it.

image::ug-findcMultiplePart1.png[]

You will obtain clients which have `bryan` in their name or `low` in the name. In the case below, there are 3 clients. `Bryan Low`, `Bryan Tan` and `Alice Low`.

image::ug-findcMultiplePart2.png[]

You can try to enter keywords for `NAME` that are more specific to the client you are looking for. This will help to keep your search more scoped.

=== Add a new client profile: `add-c`

Initialises and adds a new client profile.

Format: `add-c n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [g/GENDER] [h/HEIGHT] [cw/CURRENT_WEIGHT] [tw/TARGET_WEIGHT] [r/REMARK] [s/SPORT]… [t/TAG]…`

* `n/NAME` is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of words will matter. e.g `Hans Ong` will not match `Ong Hans`
* Only exact match will be shown. e.g. `Hans` will not match `Hans Ong`
* A client can have any number of tags (including 0)

Examples:

* `add-c n/Ming Liang p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`
** Adds a new client: Ming Liang with the above information
* `add-c n/Low Tah Kiow, John t/powerlifter e/betsycrowe@example.com a/some street p/1234567 t/strongman`
** Adds a new client: Low Tah Kiow, John with the above information

==== Example

Let's say you want to edit the address and assign 3 sports (Tennis, Hockey, Badminton) to client `Irfan Ibrahim`. From the `Client List`, you can see that his client `INDEX` is 3.

image::UGEditCDiagram1.png[]

Next, you can enter the command `edit-c 3 a/New Address #123456 s/Tennis s/Hockey s/Badminton` in the *Command Box*.

image::UGEditCDiagram2.png[]

Enter the command, and you should see that the *Result Box* displays the edited client's information, and that the *Client List* has updated `Irfan Ibrahim` to show the new changes.

image::UGEditCDiagram3.png[]

==== Common Errors/Problems

You might face some errors or difficulties when you use edit-e. In this section, you will be able to understand these errors and resolve them.

*Result box not displaying updated client's information*

When you use `edit-c`, instead of seeing the updated client's information in the *Result Box*, you might sometimes encounter an error message informing you about the specifications for the format of the command. This error message varies according to the mistake detected in the parameters given. For simplicity, let's look at one example scenario.

Let's say you attempt to edit the email of `Irfan Ibrahim` and happen to give an incorrect format of the email that does not follow the rules given in the parameters table above for `EMAIL`. Consider the following command: `edit-c 3 e/invalidEmail`.

image::UGEditCDiagram4.png[]

As seen above, the `EMAIL` is of the wrong format as it does not include the `@` symbol and not of the `xxx@yyy` format.

In the example above, the `EMAIL` field was faulty. This behaviour of FitBiz also applies to other faulty parameters for the `edit-c` command, where FitBiz will display information relevant to the faulty parameter, to help you troubleshoot and correct your input.

Date: 12-02-2020 +
Reps: 4 +
Weight: 100 +
Sets: 4 +
|============
You can use the `add-e` command to add the exercise as shown.

1.View the client that you want to add the exercise to. For information on how to view the client, you can refer to the `view-c` section. For this example, we will add the exercise to the first client in the list, `Alex Yeoh`. After you entered `view-c 1`, you will see `Alex Yeoh` detailed information and a table of his recorded exercises.

image::ug-addeExamplePart1.png[]

2.Now type the information of the exercise, matching each detail of the exercise to the parameter. In this case, you will have to type `add-e n/Bench press d/12-02-2020 reps/4 ew/100 sets/4` into *Command Box*. To recap,

[width="50%"]
|============
The name of the exercise after `n/` +

image::ug-addeExamplePart3.png[]

==== Common errors / problems
You might face some errors or difficulties when you use `add-e`. In this section, you will be able to understand these errors and resolve them.

===== Duplicate exercises
You might wonder why the application shows you a duplicate exercise error when the details of the exercises you entered are different. It is likely that only the sets differ between the two exercises. The example below might help you understand better.

You might have the following exercise in *Exercise Table*.

image::ug-addeDuplicatePart1.png[]

If you were to enter `add-e n/Bench Press d/12-02-2020 reps/4 ew/100 sets/2` into *Command Box*, the only information that is different is the number of sets.

image::ug-addeDuplicatePart2.png[]

*Result Box* will show that you have a duplicate exercise.

image::ug-addeDuplicatePart3.png[]

To solve this, we suggest incrementing the sets of the existing exercise by using the `edit-e` command. This will help to keep your exercises consolidated and the table compact. For information on using `edit-e`, you may want to refer to the next section `Edit a client's exercise: edit-e`.

|====================

==== Example

Let's say you want to schedule a weekly Monday 11:00am to 12:00pm slot for your client Alex Yeoh. Alex Yeoh is the first client on your *Client List*.

image::UGScheduleDiagram1.png[]

You can see that Alex Yeoh's client index is `1`. Therefore, you can proceed to type the `schedule` command in the *Command Box* to assign a schedule slot to him.

image::UGScheduleDiagram2.png[]

After you enter the command, you can see that the *Result Box* has notified you of the new overwritten schedule, and that Alex Yeoh's schedule slot has appeared on the *Schedule Panel* on Monday.

image::UGScheduleDiagram3.png[]

Now let's say you want to add multiple schedules to Bernice Yu: Monday 8:00am to 10:00pm and Tuesday 4:00pm to 6:00pm. You can do that by adding both of these timings into the `schedule` command following the same format as above.

image::UGScheduleDiagram4.png[]

Now enter the command, and you'll see that Bernice's schedules also show up on the *Schedule Panel*.

image::UGScheduleDiagram5.png[]

Finally, let's say Alex no longer has any schedule slots, and you want to clear it. Simply type in `schedule 1 sch/` in the *Command Box* to clear his schedule, and you should see this.

==== Common Errors/Problems

You might face some errors or difficulties when you use `schedule`. In this section, you will be able to understand these errors and resolve them.

*Overlapping schedules*

You might encounter the message that "One or more of your input schedules have overlapping time periods. Please check again." This means that there is a overlapping time period between at least two of your input schedules. In this case as shown below, the first schedule `sch/MON-1100-1200` conflicts with the second schedule `sch/MON-1200-1300` because the end time of the first schedule overlaps with the start time of the second schedule.

[NOTE]
Overlapping schedules are not allowed between schedules within the same client. However, *different clients* can have overlapping schedules with each other as it is a possible scenario that you as a gym coach can coach multiple clients at once, and that additional clients can join/leave the session as other sessions are ongoing.

*Invalid command format*

You might encounter the error message from the *Result Box* specifying the format that you should be using for the `schedule` command. This means that there are one or more errors in the format of your input for the `schedule` command. In the example input shown below, `schedule 2 sch/TUESDAY-800-1:00`, there are multiple errors. First, the `DAY` should be three letters. Next, the `STARTTIME` and `ENDTIME` should follow the HHmm format. The correct input for this should be `schedule 2 sch/TUE-0800-1300`.

=== Export as CSV: `export` [Coming in v1.4]

Exports a client’s training record to a CSV file.

Format: `export INDEX`

* `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed client list
* `INDEX` must be a positive integer (ie. 1, 2, 3, ...)

Example:

* `export 6`
** Exports training records of the 6th client

=== Filter clients based on attribute: `filter-c` [Coming in v1.4]

Filters the client list by the specified keyword(s) that matches the name or any attributes the client has.

Format: `filter-c KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case insensitive. e.g `push ups` will match `Push Ups`
* The order of the keywords does not matter (e.g. `Push Pull` will match `Pull Push`)
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Push` will not match `Push Pull`
* Clients matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber, Bo Yang`

Examples:

* `filter-c Johnny`
** Returns a client list of `Johnny Tim` and `johnny`

=== Display visualisations of training progress: `graph` [Coming in v1.4]

Shows visualisations of a client’s exercise progress.

Format: `graph e/EXERCISE_NAME [s/START] [e/END]`

* Generates a graphical representation of the client’s progress
* If `START` or `END` is not specified, it will default to the current month
* Date format of `[s/START]`, `[e/END]` is `DD-MM-YYYY`
* This command can only be used while viewing a client (ie. right after `view-c` is used)

Examples:

* `graph e/Push Ups`
** Shows a graph of Ming Liang’s Push Ups progress over the current month

=== View schedule for the day/week: `view-s` [Coming in v2.0]

Shows the schedule for today or the time specified.

Format: `view-s TYPE`

* `TYPE` must be either `today`, `week` or `month`

Examples:

* `view schedule today`
** Shows the schedule for today
* `view schedule week`
** Shows the schedule of the current week
