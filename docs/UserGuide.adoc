== Overview

=== About FitBiz

FitBiz is a fitness business management tool tailor made for fitness coaches to manage their clients. From managing your client's profile to planning your schedules, FitBiz will surely ease the pain and monotony of managing a small to medium client portfolio.

This program is primarily a desktop application and is very optimised for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI). If you can type fast, and have clients to train and manage, FitBiz is definitely for you!

=== About this User Guide

This User Guide explains how to use FitBiz, as well as provides an understanding of the features and commands and some common use cases of this application.

In this guide, we cover:

* How to navigate the Graphical User Interface (GUI)
* Syntax of the commands available in FitBiz
* Common use cases for each command
* Common problems encountered by users

=== Understanding the Graphical User Interface (GUI)

When you first launch FitBiz, you will be greeted by the GUI. In this section, we shall discuss about what each section of this GUI is responsible for.

// diagram for hello world command box

* **Command Box**: this is where you enter your commands
** Note that the border will glow green if your command is successfully executed, and red otherwise 
* **Feedback Box**: this displays feedback and other useful information about your commands that you have just entered
* **Client List**: this displays all your clients currently recorded in FitBiz
* **Schedule Panel**: this displays all your schedules of your clients
* **Client View**: this displays all the important details about the client you are currently viewing (which we refer to as _client in view_). In here, we have 3 further sections:
** **Client Details**: this displays other information about your client that is otherwise not found in **Client List**
** **Exercise Table**: this displays all the exercises recorded for the current _client in view_
** **Personal Best Table**: this displays the personal bests of the exercises done by the current _client in view_

[TIP]
If this is your first time using FitBiz and you have just started up the application, you may realise that the *Client View* section is missing. This is because you are currently not viewing a client. Refer to <<view-c-command>> for more information about what you need to do.

=== Miscellaneous features

As this is primarily a CLI based application with lots of anticipated typing, we have provided some features to make your user experience with FitBiz much better. In this section, we shall look at the **Command History** and the **Command Autocomplete** feature, and learn how to effectively utilise them.

==== Command History

Similar to most modern CLIs, users of FitBiz can press the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] arrow key to cycle through their previously entered commands. If you have prior experience in using a CLI, feel free to skip this section as this should be second nature to you. If not, here is a quick tutorial on how to use this time saving feature.

First, start by typing anything into the *Command Box*. It _need not_ have to be a valid command (like those shown in <<Commands>>). In our example, we chose to type `Hello World`:

// diagram for hello world command box
image::command-history-hello-world.png[]

Next, hit the kbd:[Enter] key to enter the command into FitBiz. Notice that whatever you have typed in the *Command Box* should have disappeared. If you did not enter a valid command (like `Hello World`), the border of the *Command Box* would have turned red, and you would have been prompted by a message saying `Unknown command` in the *Feedback Box* like shown:

// diagram for invalid command
image::command-history-unknown-command.png[]

Next, continue entering different commands into the *Command Box*. You can safely ignore all the `Unknown command` prompts for now.

Once you feel like you have entered enough commands into FitBiz, try hitting the kbd:[&uarr;] arrow key several times. You should start to see the history of your entered commands displaying in the *Command Box* in reverse chronological order. If you press the kbd:[&uarr;] arrow key enough times (or simply hold down the key), you would realise that the command in the *Command Box* no longer changes. In our case, it currently displays `Hello World`, our first ever entered command.

Now, you can also see your more recent commands by pressing the kbd:[&darr;] arrow key. Again, if you press it enough times, you would realise that the *Command Box* will display nothing (right after displaying your most recent command). This means that you have reached the end of your command history.

[TIP]
If you are not currently browsing the history, you can press the kbd:[&darr;] arrow key to immediately clear what you are currently typing in the *Command Box*.

==== Command Autocompletion

Again, similar to most modern CLIs, users of FitBiz can press the kbd:[Tab] key to auto complete commands that they have partially typed. If the partially typed letters uniquely identifies a valid command in FitBiz (see <<Commands>>), the complete command will automatically appear in the Command Box. Otherwise, a list of all commands similar to the ambiguous letters will appear in the *Feedback Box*.

Even if you have prior experience in using a CLI, you may want to read on to learn how to autocomplete prefixes.

== Quick Start

. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer
. Download the latest `FitBiz.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here]
. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Fitness Manager
. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds
. Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. e.g. typing `help` and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
. Some example commands you can try:
* `list-c` : lists all clients
* `add-c n/John Doe g/Male p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 b/24-12-1997 h/170 cw/70 tw/75`
: adds a client named John Doe to FitBiz
* `exit` : exits the app
. Refer to <<Commands>> below for details of each command

== Commands

This section introduces the syntax and the usages of the commands available in FitBiz. In explaining the syntax, we will adhere to the following format:

* Words in `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user
** e.g. in `add-c n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add-c n/John Doe`
* Items in square brackets are optional
** e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`
* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times
** e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order
** e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable

=== View help: `help`

Opens a window with the link to the User Guide. `Currently in v1.3`
Lists all available commands and a short description of what they do. Specify the command for more detailed explanation. `Coming in v1.4`

Format: `help [c/COMMAND]`

Examples:

* `help`
** Lists all commands

==== Parameters

[options='header']
[cols="15%,85%"]
|===
| Parameters | Important points to note
| `INDEX` |
|===

* `delete-e` can only be used when a client is in view (ie. `view-c` is called first)

* `INDEX` must be a positive integer (ie. 1, 2, 3, ...)

Examples:

* `view-c 1`
+
`delete-e 4`
+
** Deletes the 4th exercise from the exercise list of the 1st client

=== Schedule trainings for a client: `schedule`

Assigns weekly schedule timings to a client. The schedule will be displayed on the right panel of FitBiz, with the timings as well as the client's name. This command can assign multiple schedules to a client at once, by adding more arguments following the command.

Format: `schedule INDEX day/DAY st/STARTTIME et/ENDTIME`

* `INDEX` refers to the index number shown on the displayed client list
* `INDEX` must be a positive integer(ie. 1, 2, 3, ...)
* `INDEX` must be for an existing client index number
* `DAY` must be any one of the following values:
** MON
** TUE
** WED
** THU
** FRI
** SAT
** SUN
* `DAY` is not case-sensitive

=== Export as CSV: `export`

`export` allows you to export your client's recorded exercises into a spreadsheet format which you can then easily save or share with your clients. Note that this will create a CSV file, which you can then view and open in other programmes like Microsoft Excel, or Google Sheets (as shown in the example later).

[NOTE]
This command can only be used when you have a client in view; make sure you know how to view a client first. Refer to <<view-c-command>> for more information.

==== Quick summary

* Only the exercises of the current client in view will be exported
* Exported files will be saved in the `/exports` directory
* The name of the exported file will be the client's name followed by the `.csv` file extension (eg. `Alex Yeoh.csv`)

==== Example

. First, ensure that you are currently viewing a client by using the `view-c` command:
+
image::export-1.png[]
. Now, if the client you are viewing currently has recorded exercises, simply enter `export` into the *Command Box*
. If the success message shows, the file should also have been successfully exported:
+
image::export-2.png[]
. Now, simply use your favourite file explorer to locate the `exports` folder, which should be created at the same directory as `FitBiz.jar`. In the `exports` folder, you will then find your exported CSV file:
+
image::export-3.png[]
. If you have a spreadsheet software (like Microsoft Excel) installed on your computer, you can easily view the CSV file by launching it. In our example, we have https://support.google.com/docs/answer/40608?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en[imported it into Google Sheets] instead:

==== Common errors/problems

If you find that you are unable to execute this command successfully, there are a few things you can check:

. Ensure that you are currently viewing a client using the `view-c` command. If you are indeed viewing a client, the *Client View* should not be empty.
. Ensure that you actually do have exercises recorded for the client currently in view using the `add-e` command. If the client does indeed have recorded exercises, the *Exercise List* should not be empty.

=== Filter clients based on attribute: `filter-c` [Coming in v1.4]

Filters the client list by the specified keyword(s) that matches the name or any attributes the client has.

Format: `filter-c KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case insensitive. e.g `push ups` will match `Push Ups`
* The order of the keywords does not matter (e.g. `Push Pull` will match `Pull Push`)
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Push` will not match `Push Pull`
* Clients matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber, Bo Yang`

Examples:

* `filter-c Johnny`
** Returns a client list of `Johnny Tim` and `johnny`

=== Display visualisations of training progress: `graph` [Coming in v1.4]

Shows visualisations of a client’s exercise progress.

Format: `graph e/EXERCISE_NAME [s/START] [e/END]`

* Generates a graphical representation of the client’s progress
* If `START` or `END` is not specified, it will default to the current month
* Date format of `[s/START]`, `[e/END]` is `DD-MM-YYYY`
* This command can only be used while viewing a client (ie. right after `view-c` is used)

Examples:

* `graph e/Push Ups`
** Shows a graph of Ming Liang’s Push Ups progress over the current month

=== View schedule for the day/week: `view-s` [Coming in v2.0]

Shows the schedule for today or the time specified.

Format: `view-s TYPE`

* `TYPE` must be either `today`, `week` or `month`

Examples:

* `view schedule today`
** Shows the schedule for today
* `view schedule week`
** Shows the schedule of the current week
