== Overview

=== About FitBiz

FitBiz is a fitness business management tool tailor made for fitness coaches to manage their clients. From managing your client's profile to planning your schedules, FitBiz will surely ease the pain and monotony of managing a small to medium client portfolio.

This program is primarily a desktop application and is very optimised for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI). If you can type fast, and have clients to train and manage, FitBiz is definitely for you!

=== About this User Guide

This User Guide explains how to use FitBiz, as well as provides an understanding of the features and commands and some common use cases of this application.

In this guide, we cover:

* How to navigate the Graphical User Interface (GUI)
* Syntax of the commands available in FitBiz
* Common use cases for each command
* Common problems encountered by users

=== Understanding the Graphical User Interface (GUI)

When you first launch FitBiz, you will be greeted by the GUI. In this section, we shall learn about what each section of this GUI is responsible for.

// diagram for hello world command box
.FitBiz GUI Layout
image::Ui-annotated.png[]

* **Command Box**: this is where you enter your commands
** Note that the border will glow green if your command is successfully executed, and red otherwise
* **Result Box**: this displays feedback and other useful information about your commands that you have just entered
* **Client List**: this displays all your clients currently recorded in FitBiz
* **Schedule Panel**: this displays all your schedules of your clients
* **Client View**: this displays all the important details about the client you are currently viewing (which we refer to as _client in view_). In here, we have 3 further sections:
** **Client Details**: this displays other information about your client that is otherwise not found in **Client List**
** **Exercise Table**: this displays all the exercises recorded for the current _client in view_
** **Personal Best Table**: this displays the personal bests of the exercises done by the current _client in view_

[TIP]
If this is your first time using FitBiz and you have just started up the application, you may realise that the *Client View* section is missing. This is because you are currently not viewing a client. Refer to <<view-c-command>> for more information about what you need to do.

=== Understanding the Command Line Interface (CLI) --- Aaron Choo

Even though FitBiz comes with a GUI, it is mainly used to display data. Most of the user interaction occurs via the CLI, which in FitBiz is comprised of the *Command Box* and *Result Box*. We understand that CLIs have higher barriers of entry and may scare some inexperienced users away. As such, we have provided some features common to most modern CLIs to make your user experience with FitBiz much better. In this section, we shall look at the **Command History** and the **Command Autocomplete** feature, and learn how to effectively utilise them.

==== Command History

Similar to most modern CLIs, users of FitBiz can press the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] arrow key to cycle through their previously entered commands. If you have prior experience in using a CLI, feel free to skip this section as this should be second nature to you. If not, here is a quick tutorial on how to use this time saving feature.

First, start by typing anything into the *Command Box*. It _need not_ have to be a valid command (like those shown in <<Commands>>). In our example, we chose to type `Hello World`:

// diagram for hello world command box
image::command-history-hello-world.png[]

Next, hit the kbd:[Enter] key to enter the command into FitBiz. Notice that whatever you have typed in the *Command Box* should have disappeared. If you did not enter a valid command (like `Hello World`), the border of the *Command Box* would have turned red, and you would have been prompted by a message saying `Unknown command` in the *Result Box* like shown:

// diagram for invalid command
image::command-history-unknown-command.png[]

Next, continue entering different commands into the *Command Box*. You can safely ignore all the `Unknown command` prompts for now.

Once you feel like you have entered enough commands into FitBiz, try hitting the kbd:[&uarr;] arrow key several times. You should start to see the history of your entered commands displaying in the *Command Box* in reverse chronological order. If you press the kbd:[&uarr;] arrow key enough times (or simply hold down the key), you would realise that the command in the *Command Box* no longer changes. In our case, it currently displays `Hello World`, our first ever entered command.

Now, you can also see your more recent commands by pressing the kbd:[&darr;] arrow key. Again, if you press it enough times, you would realise that the *Command Box* will display nothing (right after displaying your most recent command). This means that you have reached the end of your command history.

[TIP]
If you are not currently browsing the history, you can press the kbd:[&darr;] arrow key to immediately clear what you are currently typing in the *Command Box*.

==== Command Autocompletion

Again, similar to most modern CLIs, users of FitBiz can press the kbd:[Tab] key to autocomplete commands that they have partially typed. If the partially typed letters uniquely identifies a valid command in FitBiz (see <<Commands>>), the complete command will automatically appear in the Command Box. Otherwise, a list of all commands similar to the ambiguous letters will appear in the *Result Box*.

Also, we understand that some of FitBiz's commands may be very long and diffcult to remember. In order to remedy this, we have also provided *autocompletion of parameter prefixes*, as well as the ability to *use tab to easily get to the next prefix*.

To see this feature in action, type `add-c` into the *Command Box* and press kbd:[Tab]:

image::autocomplete-1.png[]

Immediately, you should have noticed three things:

. All the parameter prefixes pertaining to the `add-c` command should have been automatically completed for you
. Your caret should be placed right after the `n/` for you to type your parameter
. The **Result Box** shows you the usage of the command that have just been autocompleted

Now, you can also press the kbd:[Tab] key repeatedly to go to the next parameter prefix, instead of wasting time using your mouse.

Note however, that there are some similar commands in FitBiz that have the same few starting letters. For example: both `add-c` and `add-e` starts with the letter "a". As such, hitting kbd:[Tab] when you have only typed `a` in the *Command Box* will not autocomplete either command (unfortunately, FitBiz cannot read your mind). However, you will find that the command will be completed up till `add-`, the point where `add-e` and `add-c` differs. The **Result Box** will also prompt you with the list of all similar commands found:

image::autocomplete-2.png[]

To autocomplete the parameter prefixes like in the first example above, you would just have to complete the command and press kbd:[Tab] once more.

[NOTE]
The autocompletion of the parameter prefixes are only for these commands: `add-c`, `add-e`, `filter-c`, `graph`, and `schedule`. Autocompletion of prefixes for edit commands are not included as we understand that most likely than not, users would only choose to edit one field at a time.

== Quick Start

. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer
. Download the latest `FitBiz.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here]
. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Fitness Manager
. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds
. Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. e.g. typing `help` and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
. Some example commands you can try:
* `list-c` : lists all clients
* `add-c n/John Doe g/Male p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 b/24-12-1997 h/170 cw/70 tw/75`
: adds a client named John Doe to FitBiz
* `exit` : exits the app
. Refer to <<Commands>> below for details of each command

== Commands

This section introduces the syntax and the usages of the commands available in FitBiz. In explaining the syntax, we will adhere to the following format:

* Words in `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user
** e.g. in `add-c n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add-c n/John Doe`
* Items in square brackets are optional
** e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`
* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times
** e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order
** e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable

=== View help: `help`

Opens a window with the link to the User Guide. `Currently in v1.3`
Lists all available commands and a short description of what they do. Specify the command for more detailed explanation. `Coming in v1.4`

Format: `help [c/COMMAND]`

Examples:

* `help`
** Lists all commands
* `help add-c`
** Shows a detailed explanation of the `add-c` command

=== List all clients: `list-c` ---Ng Ming Liang

You can list all clients on the *Client List*. This is useful when your *Client List* has been filtered by the `filter-c` command, and you want to view all clients again. When using `list-c`, there will be no difference to the *Client List* if it is already showing all clients.

==== Parameters

Format: `list-c`

The command is simply `list-c`, and has no additional parameters.

==== Example

Let's say you start off with the full *Client List* as shown below.

image::UGListCDiagram0.png[]

Now, let's say you use the command `filter-c` to filter the clients with the `Paleo` tag as such:

image::UGListCDiagram2.png[]

Your *Client List* will now display only the clients that have the `Paleo` tag. In this example, the only client that fit this requirement is `Alex Yeoh`.

image::UGListCDiagram3.png[]

Let's say you are done with the filter, and want to list all your clients on the *Client List* again. Simply enter `list-c`into the *Command Box* and you should be able to see the following:

image::UGListCDiagram4.png[]

==== Common errors / problems

*No clients shown on the Client List*

You may be greeted with the following scene. This means that there are no clients in your FitBiz. You can begin adding clients by using the `add-c` command. Do refer to the `add-c` section in this document for help regarding `add-c`.

image::UGListCDiagram1.png[]

=== Find clients by name: `find-c` --- Yong Jie
`find-c` allows you to find clients with the names that are specified in your input. You might have many clients and finding a particular client by scrolling through the entire *Client List* might be troublesome and difficult. `find-c` is the command for you.

==== Parameters
This section acts as a summary of the important things to note when using `find-c` including their parameters.

Format: `find-c NAME`

[options='header']
[cols="15%,85%"]
|====================
| Parameters | Important points to note
| NAME |
* Substitute `NAME` with keywords you want to search with +

* You can use multiple keywords for `NAME`. +
e.g. You can enter `find-c bryan low`.

* The `NAME` keywords are case insensitive. +
e.g. Typing `find-c hans` will show clients even with the name `Hans`. +
For a better understanding, you can refer to the example section .

* The keywords used for `NAME` have to match at least one word in the name of the clients. +
e.g. Typing `find-c Bry` will not show clients with the name `Bryan`. +
For a detailed explanation, you can refer to the commons errors / problems section.

* Clients matching at least one `NAME` keyword will be returned and does not require all the words in their name to match. +
e.g. Typing `find-c Hans Bo` will show clients `Hans Gruber` and `Bo Yang` and not necessarily just client `Hans Bo`. +
For a detailed explanation, you can refer to the commons errors / problems section.
|====================

==== Example
Let's say that you want to find a client named "Bryan Low" in *Client List*. You can simply use the `find-c` command as shown.

1.Type `find-c bryan` into *Command Box*, and press `Enter` to execute it.

image::ug-findcExamplePart1.png[]

2.*Result Box* will display the message of the number of clients listed. In this case, there are 2 clients with "bryan" in their name.

image::ug-findcExamplePart2.png[]

3.You can now see the clients with "bryan" in their names. As you can see, the name you use to search does not need to be case-senstive. The client that we are looking for "Bryan Low" is in *Client List*.

image::ug-findcExamplePart3.png[]

==== Common errors / problems
You might face some errors or difficulties when you `find-c`. In this section, you will be able to understand these errors and resolve them. You will also get a better understanding of the reply from the result box when using `find-c`.

===== Using incomplete names
You might wonder why `find-c` do not show the clients even though the client is clearly in your client list records. It might be possible that you have entered an incomplete name and does not match any word in the name of that client. The example below might help you understand better.

Example:
You want to find the client named "Bryan Low" in *Client List*. Below shows that "Bryan Low" indeed exists and is recorded.

image::ug-findcIncompleteNamePart1.png[]

Type `find-c bry` into *Command Box*, and press `Enter` to execute it.

image::ug-findcIncompleteNamePart2.png[]

You will obtain "0 clients listed!" in *Result Box*.

image::ug-findcIncompleteNamePart3.png[]

This is because the name that you have entered is incomplete and does not match any word in the name of any of the clients. To correct this, you have to enter `find-c bryan` as seen in the example.

===== Using multiple keywords for `NAME`

You might wonder why the application shows more clients than you intended. It might be possible that you have misunderstood how the `NAME` parameter gets the client you are finding. The application will show clients as long as one of the words of the client match a keyword you use for name. The example below might help you understand better.

Example:
You want to find the client named "Bryan Low" in *Client List*.

Type `find-c bryan low` in to *Command Box*, and press `Enter` to execute it.

image::ug-findcMultiplePart1.png[]

You will obtain clients which have `bryan` in their name or `low` in the name. In the case below, there are 3 clients. `Bryan Low`, `Bryan Tan` and `Alice Low`.

image::ug-findcMultiplePart2.png[]

You can try to enter keywords for `NAME` that are more specific to the client you are looking for. This will help to keep your search more scoped.

=== Add a new client profile: `add-c`

Initialises and adds a new client profile.

Format: `add-c n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [g/GENDER] [h/HEIGHT] [cw/CURRENT_WEIGHT] [tw/TARGET_WEIGHT] [r/REMARK] [s/SPORT]… [t/TAG]…`

* `n/NAME` is case insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of words will matter. e.g `Hans Ong` will not match `Ong Hans`
* Only exact match will be shown. e.g. `Hans` will not match `Hans Ong`
* A client can have any number of tags (including 0)

Examples:

* `add-c n/Ming Liang p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`
** Adds a new client: Ming Liang with the above information
* `add-c n/Low Tah Kiow, John t/powerlifter e/betsycrowe@example.com a/some street p/1234567 t/strongman`
** Adds a new client: Low Tah Kiow, John with the above information

=== Edit a client’s profile: `edit-c` ---Ng Ming Liang

`edit-c` allows you to edit an existing client's details from the *Client List*. There are various attributes that can be edited for the client using this command, which will be covered in this section.

==== Parameters

This section acts as a summary of the important things to note when using `edit-c` and its parameters. The square bracket shows that it is optional and your command will still execute even if you do not enter them. However, at least one of them have to be specified. The ellipsis after a parameter `...` means that there can be multiple of that same type of parameter.

Format: `edit-c INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [g/GENDER] [b/BIRTHDAY] [cw/CURRENT_WEIGHT] [tw/TARGET_WEIGHT] [h/HEIGHT] [s/SPORT]... [t/TAG]... [r/REMARK]`

==== Example

Let's say you want to edit the address and assign 3 sports (Tennis, Hockey, Badminton) to client `Irfan Ibrahim`. From the `Client List`, you can see that his client `INDEX` is 3.

image::UGEditCDiagram1.png[]

Next, you can enter the command `edit-c 3 a/New Address #123456 s/Tennis s/Hockey s/Badminton` in the *Command Box*.

image::UGEditCDiagram2.png[]

Enter the command, and you should see that the *Result Box* displays the edited client's information, and that the *Client List* has updated `Irfan Ibrahim` to show the new changes.

image::UGEditCDiagram3.png[]

==== Common Errors/Problems

You might face some errors or difficulties when you use edit-e. In this section, you will be able to understand these errors and resolve them.

*Result box not displaying updated client's information*

When you use `edit-c`, instead of seeing the updated client's information in the *Result Box*, you might sometimes encounter an error message informing you about the specifications for the format of the command. This error message varies according to the mistake detected in the parameters given. For simplicity, let's look at one example scenario.

Let's say you attempt to edit the email of `Irfan Ibrahim` and happen to give an incorrect format of the email that does not follow the rules given in the parameters table above for `EMAIL`. Consider the following command: `edit-c 3 e/invalidEmail`.

image::UGEditCDiagram4.png[]

As seen above, the `EMAIL` is of the wrong format as it does not include the `@` symbol and not of the `xxx@yyy` format.

In the example above, the `EMAIL` field was faulty. This behaviour of FitBiz also applies to other faulty parameters for the `edit-c` command, where FitBiz will display information relevant to the faulty parameter, to help you troubleshoot and correct your input.


=== Delete a client: `delete-c`

Deletes the client at the specified index from the program.

Format: `delete-c INDEX`

* `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed client list
* `INDEX` must be a positive integer (ie. 1, 2, 3, ...)

Examples:

* `delete-c 4`
** Deletes the 4th client from the program

[[view-c-command]]
=== View a client profile: `view-c`

Shows all available information of the client at the specified index. This also displays all the exercises recorded for the client as well as their personal bests for said exercises.

Format: `view-c INDEX`

* `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed client list
* `INDEX` must be a positive integer (ie. 1, 2, 3, ...)

Examples:

* `view-c 3`
** Shows all information about the 3rd client
* `view-c 45`
** Shows all information about the 45th client

=== Add a client's exercise: `add-e`  --- YongJie
`add-e` allows you to record an exercise done by the client that you are currently viewing. You will be able to see the exercises recorded and their information in the *Exercise Table*.

==== Parameters
This section acts as a summary of the important things to note when using `add-e` including their parameters. The square bracket shows that it is optional and your command will still execute even if you do not enter them.

Format: `add-e n/EXERCISE_NAME d/DATE [ew/EXERCISE_WEIGHT] [reps/REPS] [sets/SETS]`

[options='header']
[cols="15%,85%"]
|====================
| Parameters | Important points to note
| n/NAME |
* Substitute `NAME` with the name of the exercise. +

* `n/NAME` is compulsory and you have to specify it. +

* `n/NAME` is case sensitive. +
e.g. An exercise named `pushup` will be considered to have a different name as an exercise named `Pushup`.

| d/DATE |
* Substitute `DATE` with the date of the exercise. +

* `d/DATE` is compulsory and you have to specify it. +

* `DATE` must be of the form `DD-MM-YYYY` (ie. 02-07-2020 for 2nd July 2020)

* The range of `DATE` is from one year before the current date to the current date (inclusive).

| [reps/REPS] |
* Substitute `REPS` with the reps of the exercise. +

* `reps/REPS` is optional.

* Range for `REPS` is 1-9999. +

|====================

==== Example
Let's say that you want to add an exercise with the following details: +
[width="50%"]
|============
Name: Bench Press +
Date: 12-02-2020 +
Reps: 4 +
Weight: 100 +
Sets: 4 +
|============
You can use the `add-e` command to add the exercise as shown.

1.View the client that you want to add the exercise to. For information on how to view the client, you can refer to the `view-c` section. For this example, we will add the exercise to the first client in the list, `Alex Yeoh`. After you entered `view-c 1`, you will see `Alex Yeoh` detailed information and a table of his recorded exercises.

image::ug-addeExamplePart1.png[]

2.Now type the information of the exercise, matching each detail of the exercise to the parameter. In this case, you will have to type `add-e n/Bench press d/12-02-2020 reps/4 ew/100 sets/4` into *Command Box*. To recap,

[width="50%"]
|============
The name of the exercise after `n/` +
The date of the exercise after `d/` +
The reps of the exercise after `reps/` +
The weight of the exercise after `ew/` +
The sets of the exercise after `sets/` +
|============

Press enter to execute it.

image::ug-addeExamplePart2.png[]

3.After it has been successfully entered, *Result Box* will display the recorded exercise. You will also be able to see the recorded exercise in the *Exercise Table*.

image::ug-addeExamplePart3.png[]

==== Common errors / problems
You might face some errors or difficulties when you use `add-e`. In this section, you will be able to understand these errors and resolve them.

===== Duplicate exercises
You might wonder why the application shows you a duplicate exercise error when the details of the exercises you entered are different. It is likely that only the sets differ between the two exercises. The example below might help you understand better.

You might have the following exercise in *Exercise Table*.

image::ug-addeDuplicatePart1.png[]

If you were to enter `add-e n/Bench Press d/12-02-2020 reps/4 ew/100 sets/2` into *Command Box*, the only information that is different is the number of sets.

image::ug-addeDuplicatePart2.png[]

*Result Box* will show that you have a duplicate exercise.

image::ug-addeDuplicatePart3.png[]

To solve this, we suggest incrementing the sets of the existing exercise by using the `edit-e` command. This will help to keep your exercises consolidated and the table compact. For information on using `edit-e`, you may want to refer to the next section `Edit a client's exercise: edit-e`.

=== Edit a client's exercise: `edit-e` --- YongJie

|====================
==== Example
Let's say that you want to edit an exercise done by the client you are currently viewing. The exercise that you want to edit is the one highlighted in the photo below.

image::ug-editeExamplePart1.png[]

The exercise, "Bench Press", currently is 4 reps and weight of 100. However, they might be entered wrongly and you want to change the values. You can use the `edit-e` command to edit the exercise as shown.

1.Identify the index of the exercise in *Exercise Table*. From the photo above, the index is 2. Type `edit-e 2 reps/8 ew/50` into *Command Box*. To recap,

[width="50%"]
|============
The reps of the exercise after `reps/` +
The weight of the exercise after `ew/` +
|============

Press enter to execute it.

image::ug-editeExamplePart2.png[]

2.After it has been successfully entered, *Result Box* will display a success message that the exercise has been edited. You will also be able to see the edited exercise in *Exercise Table*.

image::ug-editeExamplePart3.png[]

==== Common errors / problems
You might face some errors or difficulties when you use `edit-e`. In this section, you will be able to understand these errors and resolve them.

===== Duplicate exercises
You might wonder why the application shows you a duplicate exercise error when you do not have a duplicate of the edited exercise. It is likely that only the sets differ between the two exercises. The example below might help you understand better.

You might have the following exercise in *Exercise Table*.

image::ug-editeDuplicatePart1.png[]

If you were to enter `edit-e 2 n/Bench Press d/12-02-2020 reps/4 ew/100 sets/2` into *Command Box*, the only information that is different is the number of sets.

image::ug-editeDuplicatePart2.png[]

*Result Box* will show that you have a duplicate exercise.

image::ug-editeDuplicatePart3.png[]

To solve this, we suggest you delete the exercise you want to edit and increment the sets of the existing exercise by using the `edit-e` command. This will help to keep your exercises consolidated and the table compact.

=== Delete a client's exercise: `delete-e`

`delete-e` allows you to delete a previously recorded exercise of the client currently in view.

*Format*: `delete-e INDEX`

[NOTE]
This command can only be used when you have a client in view; make sure you know how to view a client first. Refer to <<view-c-command>> for more information.

[WARNING]
Deleting an exercise from FitBiz is permanent and *cannot be undone*.

==== Parameters

[options='header']
[cols="15%,85%"]
|===
| Parameters | Important points to note
| `INDEX` | Substitute `INDEX` with the actual index of the exercise shown on the *Exercise Table*

Must be a positive integer (eg. 1, 2, 3, ...)
|===

==== Example

. First, ensure that you are currently viewing a client by using the `view-c` command:
+
image::delete-e-1.png[]
. Say for example that you want to delete the fifth exercise found on the **Exercise Table** (the one named "Bench Press" done on "07-04-2020"), simply enter `delete-e 5`:
+
image::delete-e-2.png[]
. After the command has been successfully executed, the specified exercise should have been deleted. Notice also, in the *Personal Best Table* that the personal best for "Bench Press" has also been automatically updated to reflect this change:
+
image::delete-e-3.png[]

==== Common errors/problems

If you find that you are unable to execute this command successfully, there are a few things you can check:

. Ensure that you are currently viewing a client using the `view-c` command. If you are indeed viewing a client, the *Client View* should not be empty.
. Ensure that you actually have exercises to delete and that the `INDEX` specified is correct. If the client does indeed have recorded exercises, the *Exercise List* should not be empty.

=== Schedule trainings for a client: `schedule` ---Ng Ming Liang

`Schedule` allows you to assign weekly schedule timings to a client. The schedule will be displayed on the right panel of FitBiz, with the timings as well as the client's name. You can assign multiple schedules to a client at once, by adding more arguments following the command. All of the schedules from the current *Client List* will be displayed on the *Schedule Panel*.

[NOTE]
The `schedule` command overwrites the client's existing schedule with the new schedules given in the command.

==== Parameters

This section acts as a summary of the important things to note when using `schedule`. The square bracket shows that it is optional and your command will still execute even if you do not enter them.

Format: `schedule INDEX sch/DAY-STARTTIME-ENDTIME [sch/DAY-STARTTIME-ENDTIME]...`

[options='header']
[cols="15%,85%"]
|====================
| Parameters | Important points to note
| INDEX |
* Substitute `INDEX` with the index of the desired client to add the schedule to. +

* `INDEX` is compulsory and you have to specify it. +

* `INDEX` must be a positive number, and must be a valid index number for a client as displayed from the list of clients. +

| DAY |
* Substitute `DAY` with the first three letters of the day. +
eg. MON / TUE / WED / THU / FRI / SAT / SUN

* `DAY` is compulsory and you have to specify it. +

* `DAY` can only be one of the above seven values. +

* `DAY` is not case sensitive.

| STARTTIME |
* Substitute `STARTTIME` with the starting time of the schedule slot. +

* `STARTTIME` is compulsory.

* Range for `STARTTIME` is 0000-2359. +

* `STARTTIME` must always be earlier than or equal to `ENDTIME`.

| ENDTIME |
* Substitute `ENDTIME` with the ending time of the schedule slot. +

* `ENDTIME` is compulsory.

* Range for `ENDTIME` is 0000-2359. +

* `ENDTIME` must always be equal to or later than `STARTTIME`.
|====================

==== Example

Let's say you want to schedule a weekly Monday 11:00am to 12:00pm slot for your client Alex Yeoh. Alex Yeoh is the first client on your *Client List*.

image::UGScheduleDiagram1.png[]

You can see that Alex Yeoh's client index is `1`. Therefore, you can proceed to type the `schedule` command in the *Command Box* to assign a schedule slot to him.

image::UGScheduleDiagram2.png[]

After you enter the command, you can see that the *Result Box* has notified you of the new overwritten schedule, and that Alex Yeoh's schedule slot has appeared on the *Schedule Panel* on Monday.

image::UGScheduleDiagram3.png[]

Now let's say you want to add multiple schedules to Bernice Yu: Monday 8:00am to 10:00pm and Tuesday 4:00pm to 6:00pm. You can do that by adding both of these timings into the `schedule` command following the same format as above.

image::UGScheduleDiagram4.png[]

Now enter the command, and you'll see that Bernice's schedules also show up on the *Schedule Panel*.

image::UGScheduleDiagram5.png[]

Finally, let's say Alex no longer has any schedule slots, and you want to clear it. Simply type in `schedule 1 sch/` in the *Command Box* to clear his schedule, and you should see this.

image::UGScheduleDiagram6.png[]

==== Common Errors/Problems

You might face some errors or difficulties when you use `schedule`. In this section, you will be able to understand these errors and resolve them.

*Overlapping schedules*

You might encounter the message that "One or more of your input schedules have overlapping time periods. Please check again." This means that there is a overlapping time period between at least two of your input schedules. In this case as shown below, the first schedule `sch/MON-1100-1200` conflicts with the second schedule `sch/MON-1200-1300` because the end time of the first schedule overlaps with the start time of the second schedule.

image::UGScheduleDiagram7.png[]

[NOTE]
Overlapping schedules are not allowed between schedules within the same client. However, *different clients* can have overlapping schedules with each other as it is a possible scenario that you as a gym coach can coach multiple clients at once, and that additional clients can join/leave the session as other sessions are ongoing.

*Invalid command format*

You might encounter the error message from the *Result Box* specifying the format that you should be using for the `schedule` command. This means that there are one or more errors in the format of your input for the `schedule` command. In the example input shown below, `schedule 2 sch/TUESDAY-800-1:00`, there are multiple errors. First, the `DAY` should be three letters. Next, the `STARTTIME` and `ENDTIME` should follow the HHmm format. The correct input for this should be `schedule 2 sch/TUE-0800-1300`.

image::UGScheduleDiagram8.png[]
=== Export as CSV: `export`

`export` allows you to export your client's recorded exercises into a spreadsheet format which you can then easily save or share with your clients. Note that this will create a CSV file, which you can then view and open in other programmes like Microsoft Excel, or Google Sheets (as shown in the example later).

[NOTE]
This command can only be used when you have a client in view; make sure you know how to view a client first. Refer to <<view-c-command>> for more information.

==== Quick summary

* Only the exercises of the current client in view will be exported
* Exported files will be saved in the `/exports` directory
* The name of the exported file will be the client's name followed by the `.csv` file extension (eg. `Alex Yeoh.csv`)

==== Example

. First, ensure that you are currently viewing a client by using the `view-c` command:
+
image::export-1.png[]
. Now, if the client you are viewing currently has recorded exercises, simply enter `export` into the *Command Box*
. If the success message shows, the file should also have been successfully exported:
+
image::export-2.png[]
. Now, simply use your favourite file explorer to locate the `exports` folder, which should be created at the same directory as `FitBiz.jar`. In the `exports` folder, you will then find your exported CSV file:
+
image::export-3.png[]
. If you have a spreadsheet software (like Microsoft Excel) installed on your computer, you can easily view the CSV file by launching it. In our example, we have https://support.google.com/docs/answer/40608?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en[imported it into Google Sheets] instead:
+
image::export-4.png[]


==== Common errors/problems

If you find that you are unable to execute this command successfully, there are a few things you can check:

. Ensure that you are currently viewing a client using the `view-c` command. If you are indeed viewing a client, the *Client View* should not be empty.
. Ensure that you actually do have exercises recorded for the client currently in view using the `add-e` command. If the client does indeed have recorded exercises, the *Exercise List* should not be empty.

=== Filter clients based on attribute: `filter-c` [Coming in v1.4]

Filters the client list by the specified keyword(s) that matches the name or any attributes the client has.

Format: `filter-c KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case insensitive. e.g `push ups` will match `Push Ups`
* The order of the keywords does not matter (e.g. `Push Pull` will match `Pull Push`)
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Push` will not match `Push Pull`
* Clients matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber, Bo Yang`

Examples:

* `filter-c Johnny`
** Returns a client list of `Johnny Tim` and `johnny`

=== Display visualisations of training progress: `graph` [Coming in v1.4]

Shows visualisations of a client’s exercise progress.

Format: `graph e/EXERCISE_NAME [s/START] [e/END]`

* Generates a graphical representation of the client’s progress
* If `START` or `END` is not specified, it will default to the current month
* Date format of `[s/START]`, `[e/END]` is `DD-MM-YYYY`
* This command can only be used while viewing a client (ie. right after `view-c` is used)

Examples:

* `graph e/Push Ups`
** Shows a graph of Ming Liang’s Push Ups progress over the current month

=== View schedule for the day/week: `view-s` [Coming in v2.0]

Shows the schedule for today or the time specified.

Format: `view-s TYPE`

* `TYPE` must be either `today`, `week` or `month`

Examples:

* `view schedule today`
** Shows the schedule for today
* `view schedule week`
** Shows the schedule of the current week
