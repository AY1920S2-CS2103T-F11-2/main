== Overview

=== About FitBiz

FitBiz is a business management tool tailor made for fitness coaches to manage their clients. From managing your client's profile to planning your schedules, FitBiz will surely ease the pain and monotony of managing a small to medium client portfolio.

This program is primarily a desktop application and optimised for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI). If you can type fast, and have clients to train and manage, FitBiz is definitely for you!

=== About this User Guide

This User Guide explains how to use the FitBiz CLI, as well as provides an understanding of the features and commands and some common use cases.

In this guide, we cover:

* Syntax of the commands available in FitBiz
* Common use cases for each command

=== Miscellaneous Features

As this is primarily a CLI based application, some features are included to make the user experience better. The following features are provided to simplify the use of FitBiz:

* Command History: similar to most modern CLIs, users can press the kbd:[Up] and kbd:[Down] arrow key to cycle through their previously entered commands. This history is persisted in the storage, allowing users to quickly reference what they have entered in a previous usage of this app.
* Command Auto Completion: again, similar to most modern CLIs, users can press the kbd:[Tab] key to auto complete the commands that they have partially typed. If the partially typed letters begin a string that uniquely identifies a command, the complete command name appears. Otherwise, a list of all commands similar to the ambiguous letters will appear.

== Quick Start

. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer
. Download the latest `FitBiz.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here]
. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Fitness Manager
. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds
. Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. e.g. typing `help` and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
. Some example commands you can try:
* `list-c` : lists all clients
* `add-c n/John Doe g/Male p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 b/24-12-1997 h/170 cw/70 tw/75`
: adds a client named John Doe to FitBiz
* `exit` : exits the app
. Refer to <<Commands>> below for details of each command

== Commands

This section introduces the syntax and the usages of the commands available in FitBiz. In explaining the syntax, we will adhere to the following format:

* Words in `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user
** e.g. in `add-c n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add-c n/John Doe`
* Items in square brackets are optional
** e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`
* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times
** e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order
** e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable

=== View help: `help`

Opens a window with the link to the User Guide. `Currently in v1.3`
Lists all available commands and a short description of what they do. Specify the command for more detailed explanation. `Coming in v1.4`

Format: `help [c/COMMAND]`

Examples:

* `help`

=== List all clients: `list-c`

Format: `list-c`

=== Add a new client profile: `add-c`

After setting up the program, the first thing you might want to do is to add your client to FitBiz. You can do so by using the `add-c` command, followed by the details of your client.

The format of the command is:

`add-c n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [g/GENDER] [b/BIRTHDAY] [h/HEIGHT] [cw/CURRENT_WEIGHT] [tw/TARGET_WEIGHT] [r/REMARK] [s/SPORT]… [t/TAG]…`

Here are some things to note:

* The order of the name matters. e.g `Hans Ong` will not match `Ong Hans`
* `p/PHONE_NUMBER` should be longer than 2 digits and contain numbers only
* `e/EMAIL` needs to be a valid email
* `a/ADDRESS` can be any value
* `g/GENDER` is case insensitive and can be `male` or `m` for male, `female` or `f` for female, `others` or `o` for others

* `h/HEIGHT` is in cm and must be non-negative. It can either be a whole number with maximum 3 digits or a decimal with maximum of 2 decimal places

** Result: Ming Liang with the above information has been added
* `add-c n/Low Tah Kiow, John t/powerlifter e/betsycrowe@example.com a/some street p/1234567 t/strongman`
