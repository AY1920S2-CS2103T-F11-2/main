== Overview

=== About FitBiz

FitBiz is a business management tool tailor made for fitness coaches to manage their clients. From managing your client's profile to planning your schedules, FitBiz will surely ease the pain and monotony of managing a small to medium client portfolio.

This program is primarily a desktop application and optimised for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI). If you can type fast, and have clients to train and manage, FitBiz is definitely for you!

=== About this User Guide

This User Guide explains how to use the FitBiz CLI, as well as provides an understanding of the features and commands and some common use cases.

In this guide, we cover:

* Syntax of the commands available in FitBiz
* Common use cases for each command

=== Miscellaneous Features

As this is primarily a CLI based application, some features are included to make the user experience better. The following features are provided to simplify the use of FitBiz:

* Command History: similar to most modern CLIs, users can press the kbd:[Up] and kbd:[Down] arrow key to cycle through their previously entered commands. This history is persisted in the storage, allowing users to quickly reference what they have entered in a previous usage of this app.
* Command Auto Completion: again, similar to most modern CLIs, users can press the kbd:[Tab] key to auto complete the commands that they have partially typed. If the partially typed letters begin a string that uniquely identifies a command, the complete command name appears. Otherwise, a list of all commands similar to the ambiguous letters will appear.

== Quick Start

. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer
. Download the latest `FitBiz.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here]
. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Fitness Manager
. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds
. Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. e.g. typing `help` and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
. Some example commands you can try:
* `list-c` : lists all clients
* `add-c n/John Doe g/Male p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 b/24-12-1997 h/170 cw/70 tw/75`
: adds a client named John Doe to FitBiz
* `exit` : exits the app
. Refer to <<Commands>> below for details of each command

== Commands

This section introduces the syntax and the usages of the commands available in FitBiz. In explaining the syntax, we will adhere to the following format:

* Words in `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user
** e.g. in `add-c n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add-c n/John Doe`
* Items in square brackets are optional
** e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`
* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times
** e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order
** e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable

=== Schedule trainings for a client: `schedule` ---Ng Ming Liang

`Schedule` allows you to assign weekly schedule timings to a client. The schedule will be displayed on the right panel of FitBiz, with the timings as well as the client's name. You can assign multiple schedules to a client at once, by adding more arguments following the command.

[NOTE]
The `schedule` command overwrites the client's existing schedule with the new schedules given in the command.

==== Parameters

This section acts as a summary of the important things to note when using `schedule`. The square bracket shows that it is optional and your command will still execute even if you do not enter them.

Format: `schedule INDEX sch/DAY-STARTTIME-ENDTIME`

[options='header']
[cols="15%,85%"]
|====================
| Parameters | Important points to note
| INDEX |
* Substitute `INDEX` with the index of the desired client to add the schedule to. +

* `INDEX` is compulsory and you have to specify it. +

* `INDEX` must be a positive number, and must be a valid index number for a client as displayed from the list of clients. +

| DAY |
* Substitute `DAY` with the first three letters of the day. +
eg. MON / TUE / WED / THU / FRI / SAT / SUN

* `DAY` is compulsory and you have to specify it. +

* `DAY` can only be one of the above seven values. +

* `DAY` is not case sensitive.

| STARTTIME |
* Substitute `STARTTIME` with the starting time of the schedule slot. +

* `STARTTIME` is compulsory.

* Range for `STARTTIME` is 0000-2359. +

* `STARTTIME` must always be earlier than or equal to `ENDTIME`.

| ENDTIME |

|====================

==== Example

Let's say you want to schedule a weekly Monday 11:00am to 12:00pm slot for your client Alex Yeoh. Alex Yeoh is the first client on your *Client List*.

image::UGScheduleDiagram1.png[]

You can see that Alex Yeoh's client index is `1`. Therefore, you can proceed to type the `schedule` command in the *Command Box* to assign a schedule slot to him.

image::UGScheduleDiagram2.png[]

After you enter the command, you can see that the *Feedback Box* has notified you of the new overwritten schedule, and that Alex Yeoh's schedule slot has appeared on the *Schedule Panel* on Monday.

image::UGScheduleDiagram3.png[]

Now let's say you want to add multiple schedules to Bernice Yu: Monday 8:00am to 10:00pm and Tuesday 4:00pm to 6:00pm. You can do that by adding both of these timings into the `schedule` command following the same format as above.

image::UGScheduleDiagram4.png[]

Now enter the command, and you'll see that Bernice's schedules also show up on the *Schedule Panel*.

image::UGScheduleDiagram5.png[]

Finally, let's say Alex no longer has any schedule slots, and you want to clear it. Simply type in `schedule 1 sch/` in the *Command Box* to clear his schedule, and you should see this.

==== Common Errors/Problems

You might face some errors or difficulties when you use `schedule`. In this section, you will be able to understand these errors and resolve them.

*Overlapping schedules*

You might encounter the message that "One or more of your input schedules have overlapping time periods. Please check again." This means that there is a overlapping time period between at least two of your input schedules. In this case as shown below, the first schedule `sch/MON-1100-1200` conflicts with the second schedule `sch/MON-1200-1300` because the end time of the first schedule overlaps with the start time of the second schedule.

image::UGScheduleDiagram7.png[]

[NOTE]
Overlapping schedules are not allowed between schedules within the same client. However, *different clients* can have overlapping schedules with each other as it is a possible scenario that you as a gym coach can coach multiple clients at once, and that additional clients can join/leave the session as other sessions are ongoing. 

*Invalid command format*

You might encounter the error message from the *Feedback Box* specifying the format that you should be using for the `schedule` command. This means that there are one or more errors in the format of your input for the `schedule` command. In the example input shown below, `schedule 2 sch/TUESDAY-800-1:00`, there are multiple errors. First, the `DAY` should be three letters. Next, the `STARTTIME` and `ENDTIME` should follow the HHmm format. The correct input for this should be `schedule 2 sch/TUE-0800-1300`.

=== Export as CSV: `export` [Coming in v1.4]

Exports a client’s training record to a CSV file.

Format: `export INDEX`

* `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed client list
* `INDEX` must be a positive integer (ie. 1, 2, 3, ...)

Example:

* `export 6`
** Exports training records of the 6th client

=== Filter clients based on attribute: `filter-c` [Coming in v1.4]

Filters the client list by the specified keyword(s) that matches the name or any attributes the client has.

Format: `filter-c KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case insensitive. e.g `push ups` will match `Push Ups`
* The order of the keywords does not matter (e.g. `Push Pull` will match `Pull Push`)
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Push` will not match `Push Pull`
* Clients matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber, Bo Yang`

Examples:

* `filter-c Johnny`
** Returns a client list of `Johnny Tim` and `johnny`

=== Display visualisations of training progress: `graph` [Coming in v1.4]

Shows visualisations of a client’s exercise progress.

Format: `graph e/EXERCISE_NAME [s/START] [e/END]`

* Generates a graphical representation of the client’s progress
* If `START` or `END` is not specified, it will default to the current month
* Date format of `[s/START]`, `[e/END]` is `DD-MM-YYYY`
