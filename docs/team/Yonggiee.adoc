== PROJECT: FitBiz

---

== Overview

FitBiz is a desktop fitness business management application. The user interacts with it using a Command Line Interface, and it has a Graphical User Interface created with JavaFX. It is written in Java version 11.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *`Exercise` classes and commands*
** What it does: allows the user to record their client's exercises. The recorded exercises will then be shown in a table for the user to see.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it is one of the main features of the application. Many other features like showing the client's personal bests and drawing their clients' progression graph rely on having the exercises recorded.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* *Major enhancement*: hooked many features from Logic to Graphical User Interface
** What it does: features are shown in GUI instead of being shown in text format.  
** Justification: In order for the application to be appealing and user-friendly, the features have to be properly displayed in the GUI. The features include:
. The exercise progession graph +
 It is a graph of the specified exercise after `graph` command. This is one of the features that is proposed to really attract users. It is a step further from the user just recording his clients' exercises and having the user see the progression of his clients over a period of time.
. The client's information displayed after `view-c` command +
We have a separate window to show the detailed client's information. This helps to reduce the clients' information displayed in the `ClientCard` in `ClientListPanel`. The user can see the essential details of each client at a glance and only see the detailed information after a `view-c` command.
. The exercise table done by the client +
The user will be able to see the exercises done by their clients' listed in a table instead of being shown text in the `ResultDisplay`. This provides a better user experience.

** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* *Minor enhancement*: refactored the `Storage` component from AB3 to Fitbiz

* *Minor enhancement*: added `Gender` and `Remarks` attributes to `Client`

=== Exercise Feature (to be edited to show latest)

The function of recording the clients' exercises is one of the main features of our application. This section provides its key implementation details.

==== Implementation

===== Exercise class

We implemented the `Exercise` class to contain the details of the exercise. An example would be the use of `ExerciseWeight` class to represent the weight of the exercise. Below shows a UML class diagram which provides further understanding of `Exercise`.

===== Exercise Commands

Currently, there are only 2 exercise commands. The `add-e` command adds an exercise to the client and the `delete-e` command deletes an exercise from a client. The commands follow a similar execution flow as other commands.

For the `add-e` command, we had to pay particular attention to the index where new Exercise is added. This is such that the exercises for the client will be displayed in descending chronological order in the table after a `view-c` command. `TableView` provides sorting for dates. However, having `TableView` to do the sorting would result in mismatch of indexes of the exercises in the `UniqueExerciseList` and in the `TableView`. This would result in problems when using `delete-e` command as it deletes the exercise at the specified index.

We will use an example of a `add-e` command to illustrate the program execution flow. Consider an instance where user inputs `add-e n/pushup d/12-12-2011 reps/20`. The `AddressBookParser` will create a `AddExerciseCommandParser`. By using `ParserUtil`, `AddExerciseCommandParser` will extract details like the reps of the exercise and pass the arguments to `AddExerciseCommand`. The sequence diagram below shows the execution flow when the AddExerciseCommand is executed. Details of exception thrown are omitted as this is a postive instance and for simplicity.

`AddExerciseCommand` checks if there is an client being viewed. For this instance, we will consider the positive case where indeed there is a client being viewed. `AddExerciseCommand` will retrieve the client being viewed from the `Model` so that details like the existing exercise list of the client can be obtained. The sequence diagram illustrates the execution flow of how the new exercise, `toAdd`, is added to the exercise list.

The exercise list, `UniqueExerciseList`, will go through a loop and iterate through the exercises in the list. The date of each exercise will be compared with the date of the `toAdd` exercise. `toAdd` will then be added to the `UniqueExerciseList` at the index to keep the list sorted.

==== Design Considerations

This section explains the our design considerations and analysis for the storage of exercises.

[options='header']
|====================
| Considerations | Pros and Cons
| Store exercises with client and all clients in one JSON file |
*Pros*: Much easier to link the exercises to the client during reading and storing

*Cons*: Might have one large JSON file and potentially exceed the size limit of a JSON file
| Store all exercises into a separate JSON file |
*Pros*: Keep exercise data separate from client data

*Cons*: Hard to link the exercises to the client during reading and storing

| Store exercises with client but one JSON for each client |
*Pros*: Low chances of exceeding the size limit of a JSON file

*Cons*: Might have too many JSON files for each client +
Tough to identify which JSON file is for which client
|====================

We decided to use the first approach of storing the exercises with the associated client and have all the clients data in one JSON file. By code wise, each `JsonAdaptedClient` will have a list of `JsonAdaptedExercise`.

image::ClientExerciseStorageClassDiagram.png[]

We want to keep the implementation reading and storing of data simple. The first approach is  the most simple. When reading the data, it removes the need to associate the exercises to the client. A client might potentially have a large amount of exercises, resulting in the reading process to be extremely slow.

Moreover, storing the exercise data from client data does not provide any performance benefits. Due to time constraints, we decided that the application should store all the data everytime it closes. This is regardless if the particular exercise or client data has been changed. Having to keep track of which data is edited and only overwrite those data would greatly increase the complexity of the application. Therefore, keeping exercises data separate from client data would be unnecessary and provide little additional functionality/benefits to the user.

Lastly, we foresee that it is improbable for the data size of both clients and exercises to exceed the maximum size limit of a JSON file. With the target user in mind, it is unlikely that he will have an enormous amount of clients as he will have to cater time for each of them. Even though each client might have many exercises, the information of each exercise is relatively small. For now, collectively, the client and exercise data is unlikely to exceed the JSON size limit. We might consider to have multiple JSON files if the data size gets too big in future versions.
