== PROJECT: FitBiz

== Overview

FitBiz is a fitness business management application, specially made for fitness coaches to manage their clients. It is primarily a desktop application where the user interacts via the Command Line Interface (CLI), and views data via the Graphical User Interface (GUI). This project is written in Java 11, packaged using Gradle, and uses JavaFX for the GUI.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the https://ay1920s2-cs2103t-f11-2.github.io/main/UserGuide.html#miscellaneous-features[Command Autocomplete] feature, which allows users to conveniently autocomplete commands and prefixes using the kbd:[Tab] key.
** *What it does*: allows the user to input FitBiz's commands with ease without having to memorise the syntax of every available command. Knowing that our target audience are fast typists and prefers to use the keyboard, this also allows users to efficiently get to the next prefix by hitting kbd:[Tab], instead of using their mouse.
** *Justification*: previously, users would have to refer to the User Guide frequently (or rely on the `help` command) for the syntax of FitBiz's commands. This feature greatly lowers the barrier of entry for this application, and also enhances the user experience by providing a much faster way for users to interact with the CLI via the keyboard.
** *Highlights*: developed a custom `Trie` data structure that was written to be easily extensible for future commands and custom logic to be added. The autocomplete system is also contextually aware, and will autocomplete the corresponding command prefixes and user help messages accordingly.

* *Major enhancement*: added the https://ay1920s2-cs2103t-f11-2.github.io/main/UserGuide.html#miscellaneous-features[Command History] feature, which allows users to store their previously entered commands, and which they can access any time using the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] keys.
** *What it does*: allows the user to efficiently access and repeat their previously entered commands (be it valid or invalid).
** *Justification*: previously, if the command was successful, users would have to type out the full command again if they had wanted to repeat it. Now, users can easily repeat or tweak their previously entered commands without wasting precious time typing everything again.
** *Highlights*: this feature was made to mimic most modern interpreters, and as such, will be very familiar to most users comfortable with using a CLI application. The history was also made to persist on the storage. As such, users can expect to come back to the application after a previous session and still access their previous command history of said session.

* *Minor enhancement*: added the `export` command which allows users to export their clients' recorded exercises into a CSV file for them to easily share with their clients.

* *Minor enhancement*: added better visual feedback cues to the GUI which will glow green if the command is successful, and red if not.
